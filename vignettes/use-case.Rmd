For anyone who is interested in exploring the Democratic primary debates of the U.S. Presidential Election, I compiled a dataset with all debates so far (i.e.: 8). 

In the following blog post I will introduce the R package `demdebates2020` which will be updated to include data from all Democratic debates as they are held. Further, I will present some possible use-cases and an exploratory analysis of the debates.

## Start

First, I load in some packages. 

```{r}
# Install these packages if you don't have them yet
# if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
# devtools::install_github("favstats/demdebates2020")

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,       # powerful data wrangling
               knitr,           # for tables
               extrafont,       # extra fonts
               ggtext,          # markdown in ggplot!
               rvest,           # for emoji scraping 
               tidytext,        # text processing
               demdebates2020,  # democratic debates datasets
               ggthemes,        # custom themes
               scales)          # for prettying up plot labels

```


To liven things up (and as a personal learning experience) I will use the great [`ggtext`](https://github.com/wilkelab/ggtext) package and include some emojis in the graphs to come.


I will now present the main dataset: `debates`. This dataset represents the spoken words of all Democratic candidates for US president at eight Democratic debates. The following [sources](https://github.com/favstats/demdebates2020#sources) have been used to compile the data: Washington Post, Des Moines Register and rev.com. The dataset has the following eight columns:

+ `speaker`: Who is speaking
+ `background`: Reactions from the audience, includes `(APPLAUSE)` or `(LAUGHTER)` 
    + only availabe for the first seven debates
+ `speech`: Transcribed speech
+ `type`: Candidate, Moderator or Protester
+ `gender`: The gender of the person speaking
+ `debate`: Which debate 
+ `day`: Which day of the debate 
    + first and second debate were held on two separate days
+ `order`: The order in which the speech acts were delivered

There are two ways in which you can access the dataset.

1. Read .csv file directly from GitHub

```{r eval=F}
debates_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/demdebates2020/master/data/debates.csv"

debates <- readr::read_csv(debates_url)

```

2. Install and load the R package like this:

```{r eval=F}
devtools::install_github("favstats/demdebates2020")

library(demdebates2020)
``` 

This is how the dataset looks like:

```{r eval=T}
demdebates2020::debates %>% 
  dplyr::slice(1502:1510) %>% 
  knitr::kable()


```

If you want to explore applause or laughter that candidates received, then you can take a look at the `background` variable.


> *Note:* as of now, `backgound` is only available for Democratic debates 1 through 7. I couldn't find a transcript source that recorded applause or laughter for the 8th debate. If you have a source, please feel free to contact me and I am happy to add it!

## Who received the most applause?

We can use the `background` variable to see who received the most applause.


```{r}

## check out who received Applause
debates %>% 
  filter(background == "(APPLAUSE)") %>% 
  dplyr::count(speaker, sort = T) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
  

```


Looks like Bernie Sanders received the most applause.

We can also create a data visualization to better emphasize the differences.

As mentioned before I will use emojis in the graphs to liven things up. In order to so, I use two functions from the great blogpost [Real emojis in ggplot2](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/real-emojis-in-ggplot2/) by Emil Hvitfeldt.

```{r}
emoji_to_link <- function(x) {
  paste0("https://emojipedia.org/emoji/",x) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes("tr td a") %>%
    .[1] %>%
    html_attr("href") %>%
    paste0("https://emojipedia.org/", .) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_node('div[class="vendor-image"] img') %>%
    html_attr("src")
}

link_to_img <- function(x, size = 25) {
  paste0("<img src='", x, "' width='", size, "'/>")
}
```

Next, I get the emoji link for üëè

```{r}
clap_emoji <- emoji_to_link("üëè") %>% link_to_img()

clap_emoji
```
And I can include that in a graph:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
## load fonts
loadfonts(device = "win")

debates %>% 
  dplyr::count(background, speaker, type, sort = T) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(background == "(APPLAUSE)") %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, n)) %>% 
  mutate(type = paste0(type, "s")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speaker, n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = type), width = 0.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggthemes::theme_hc() +
  geom_label(aes(label = n), size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free") +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_gdocs() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    legend.position = "none", 
    plot.title = element_markdown(hjust = 0.5, size = 30, margin=margin(0,0,15,0), face = "bold")
    ) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Applause", title = "Who got the <span style='color: #3E7ACF'>most Applause</span><img src='https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/clapping-hands-sign_1f44f.png' width='20'/><br>in Democratic Debates?",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 7 & 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & NBC News") 




```


```{r, echo=F}

tidytemplate::ggsave_it(applause, width = 10, height = 8)

```

We can also plot the same data as a heatmap across debates:

```{r, echo=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

debates %>% 
  filter(background == "(APPLAUSE)") %>% 
  filter(type == "Candidate") %>% 
  mutate(speaker = as.factor(speaker)) %>% 
  mutate(debate = as.factor(debate)) %>% 
  dplyr::count(background, speaker, debate, .drop = F) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(debate, speaker, fill = n)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Applause", low = "white") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    plot.title = element_markdown(hjust = 0.5, size = 30, margin=margin(0,0,15,0), face = "bold")
    ) +
  labs(x = "Debate", y = "", title = "Who got the <span style='color: #3E7ACF'>most Applause</span><img src='https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/clapping-hands-sign_1f44f.png' width='20'/><br>in Democratic Debates?",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 7 & 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & NBC News")


```


```{r, echo=F}

tidytemplate::ggsave_it(applause_heat, width = 10, height = 8)

```

## Who was the greatest jokester at democratic debates?

We can also take a look at who received the most laughs during the debates. Just filter `background` by `(LAUGHTER)`.

  
```{r}
debates %>% 
  filter(background == "(LAUGHTER)") %>% 
  dplyr::count(speaker, sort = T) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
  
```

Again, Bernie Sanders leads the field, closely followed by Andrew Yang (now dropped out) and Amy Klobuchar.

We can visualize the data to get a better grasp of the data. With the same process as before, I get the emoji link for üòÇ

```{r}
laugh_emoji <- emoji_to_link("üòÇ") %>% link_to_img()

laugh_emoji
```

And I can include that in a graph:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}


debates %>% 
  filter(background == "(LAUGHTER)") %>% 
  dplyr::count(background, speaker, type, sort = T) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speaker, n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = type), width = 0.5) +
  # geom_point(aes(fill = type), size = 9) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggthemes::theme_hc() +
  geom_label(aes(label = n), size = 3) +
  # facet_grid(~type, scales = "free_x", space = "free") +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_gdocs() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    legend.position = "none", 
    plot.title = element_markdown(size = 30, margin=margin(0,0,15,0), face = "bold")
    ) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Laughs", title = "Who got the <span style='color: #3E7ACF'>most Laughs</span><img src='https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/face-with-tears-of-joy_1f602.png' width='20'/><br>in Democratic Debates?",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 7 & 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & NBC News") 

tidytemplate::ggsave_it(laughs, width = 8, height = 8)

```


We can also plot the same data as a heatmap across debates:

```{r, echo=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

debates %>% 
  filter(background == "(LAUGHTER)") %>% 
  filter(type == "Candidate") %>% 
  mutate(speaker = as.factor(speaker)) %>% 
  mutate(debate = as.factor(debate)) %>% 
  dplyr::count(background, speaker, debate, .drop = F) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(debate, speaker, fill = n)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Laughs", low = "white") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    plot.title = element_markdown(hjust = 0.5, size = 30, margin=margin(0,0,15,0), face = "bold")
    ) +
  labs(x = "Debate", y = "", title = "Who got the <span style='color: #3E7ACF'>most Laughs</span><img src='https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/face-with-tears-of-joy_1f602.png' width='20'/><br>in Democratic Debates?",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 7 & 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & NBC News")


```


## Who spoke the most words?

```{r}
debates %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, speech) %>% 
  filter(type == "Candidate") %>%
  mutate(speaker = as.factor(speaker)) %>% 
  mutate(debate = as.factor(debate)) %>% 
  dplyr::count(speaker, .drop = F, sort = T) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  mutate(perc = round(n / total*100, 2)) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```
Again, we visualize the data.

```{r}
speak_emoji <- emoji_to_link("üó£") %>% link_to_img()

speak_emoji
```

```{r, echo=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}


debate_words <- debates %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, speech) %>% 
  filter(type == "Candidate") %>%
  mutate(speaker = as.factor(speaker)) %>% 
  mutate(debate = as.factor(debate)) %>% 
  dplyr::count(speaker, debate, .drop = F, sort = T) 

# frontrunners <- c("Bernie Sanders", 
#                   "Elizabeth Warren", 
#                   "Joe Biden", 
#                   "Pete Buttigieg", 
#                   "Amy Klobuchar")



debate_words %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(debate, speaker, fill = n)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient("Words", low = "white") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    plot.title = element_markdown(hjust = 0.5, size = 30, margin=margin(0,0,15,0), face = "bold")
    ) +
  labs(x = "Debate", y = "", title = "Who spoke the <span style='color: #3E7ACF'>most Words</span><img src='https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/speaking-head-in-silhouette_1f5e3.png' width='20'/><br>in Democratic Debates?",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & NBC News")



```

```{r, echo = F}
tidytemplate::ggsave_it(spoken_words, width = 8, height = 6)

```

We see something very obvious: as the number of candidates decreases, the spoken words also increase for the remaining candidates (as they have to fill the space).



## Did men speak more than women?

```{r, echo=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
debate_gender <- debates %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, speech) %>% 
  filter(type == "Candidate") %>%
  dplyr::count(gender, debate, .drop = F) %>% 
  group_by(debate) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  mutate(perc = n/total)

debate_gender %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>%
  ggplot(aes(debate, perc, fill = gender)) +
  geom_area(fill = "#3E7ACF", alpha = 0.75) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = paste0(round(perc*100, 1), "%")), nudge_y = 0.025,
                           direction = "y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 0.5)) +
  ggthemes::theme_hc()  +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    legend.position = "top",
    plot.title = element_markdown(size = 25, margin=margin(0,0,15,0), face = "bold")
    ) +
  labs(x = "", y = "% Spoken Words by Women\n", title = "Share of spoken Words by <span style='color: #3E7ACF'>Women</span><br>during the Democratic Debates",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & NBC News") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:8)
```

Men have spoken more words than women across all debates. Of course, throughout the debates women were always in the minority (only 6 out of 22 Democratic candidates were women and now only 2 are left: Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren).

```{r, echo = F}
tidytemplate::ggsave_it(spoken_words_gender, width = 8, height = 6)

```

## What were the most common distinct words used by candidates?

We can use tf-idf scores to tell what word combinations (bigrams) candidates used the most and also were most distinct across other candidates.

```{r, fig.width=14, fig.height=9}
speaker_words <- debates %>% 
  filter(type == "Candidate") %>% 
  mutate(speech = tm::removeWords(str_to_lower(speech), stop_words$word)) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, speech, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  count(speaker, word, sort = TRUE)
  
total_words <- speaker_words %>% 
  group_by(speaker) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n))


speaker_words <- left_join(speaker_words, total_words)


speaker_words <- speaker_words %>% 
  bind_tf_idf(word, speaker, n)



speaker_words %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  filter(speaker %in% c("Bernie Sanders", "Elizabeth Warren",
                        "Joe Biden", "Pete Buttigieg", 
                        "Andrew Yang", "Amy Klobuchar")) %>%
  group_by(speaker) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% 
  slice(1:15) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = speaker)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~speaker, ncol = 3, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()   +
  ggthemes::theme_hc() +
  # facet_grid(~type, scales = "free_x", space = "free") +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_colorblind() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Fira Code Retina"),
    legend.position = "top",
    plot.title = element_markdown(size = 30, margin=margin(0,0,20,0), face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
    ) +
  labs(x = "", y = "tf-idf", title = "Most Common Distinct Word Combinations<br>for each Democratic Presidential Candidate",
       caption = "\nDemocratic Debates: 1 - 9\nData Visualization: @favstats\nSource: Transcripts by Washington Post, Des Moines Register & rev.com")
