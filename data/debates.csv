Savannah Guthrie,NA,"All right. So with that business out of the way, we want to get to it. And we'll start this evening with Senator Elizabeth Warren.",Moderator,female,1,1,1
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Senator, good evening to you.",Moderator,female,1,1,2
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Thank you. Good to be here.,Candidate,female,1,1,3
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"You have many plans - free college, free child care, government health care, cancellation of student debt, new taxes, new regulations, the breakup of major corporations. But this comes at a time when 71 percent of Americans say the economy is doing well, including 60 percent of Democrats. What do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?",Moderator,female,1,1,4
Elizabeth Warren,NA,So I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It's doing great for giant drug companies. It's just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.,Candidate,female,1,1,5
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African Americans and Latinx whose families are torn apart, whose lives are destroyed, and whose communities are ruined.",Candidate,female,1,1,6
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.",Candidate,female,1,1,7
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"When you've got a government, when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on. And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.",Candidate,female,1,1,8
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,9
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you've called programs like free college something you might do if you were, quote, ""a magic genie."" To be blunt, are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering giving your voters, people, a false sense of what's actually achievable?",Moderator,female,1,1,10
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity. And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what's going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.",Candidate,female,1,1,11
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids. I do. But I think my plan is a good one. And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.",Candidate,female,1,1,12
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college. There's many paths to success, as well as certifications.",Candidate,female,1,1,13
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Secondly, I'd used Pell grants. I'd double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.",Candidate,female,1,1,14
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans. Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.",Candidate,female,1,1,15
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"That's time, thank you.",Moderator,female,1,1,16
Savannah Guthrie,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,1,17
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, what we've just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable. In that vein, some Democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70 percent on the very highest earners, those making more than $10 million a year. Would you support that? And if not, what would your top individual rate be?",Moderator,female,1,1,18
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn't. And it's going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.",Candidate,male,1,1,19
Beto O'Rourke,(SPEAKING IN SPANISH),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,20
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That's how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest. A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.",Candidate,male,1,1,21
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"A new democracy that is revived because we've returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now . . .",Candidate,male,1,1,22
Savannah Guthrie,NA,Congressman O'Rourke . . .,Moderator,female,1,1,23
Beto O'Rourke,NA,That's how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.,Candidate,male,1,1,24
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Congressman, that's time, sir.",Moderator,female,1,1,25
Savannah Guthrie,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,1,26
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"I'll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question. Would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate? Yes, no, or pass?",Moderator,female,1,1,27
Beto O'Rourke,NA,I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same right . . .,Candidate,male,1,1,28
Savannah Guthrie,NA,Seventy percent?,Moderator,female,1,1,29
Beto O'Rourke,NA,. . . that you - you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent. You would generate the revenues . . .,Candidate,male,1,1,30
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"okay, that's time.",Moderator,female,1,1,31
Beto O'Rourke,NA,. . . you need to pay for the programs we're talking about.,Candidate,male,1,1,32
Savannah Guthrie,NA,That's time. Thank you.,Moderator,female,1,1,33
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Senator Booker, there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations, as you know. Senator Warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. You've said we should not, quote, ""be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process."" Why do you disagree?",Moderator,female,1,1,34
Cory Booker,NA,"I don't think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can't make a living wage.",Candidate,male,1,1,35
Cory Booker,NA,We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs. And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that's hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.,Candidate,male,1,1,36
Cory Booker,NA,One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.,Candidate,male,1,1,37
Cory Booker,NA,"And I'll tell you this. I live in a low-income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street's rankings, is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.",Candidate,male,1,1,38
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"But quickly, Senator Booker, you did say that you didn't think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out, as Senator Warren has. Briefly, why is that?",Moderator,female,1,1,39
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it, number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.",Candidate,male,1,1,40
Cory Booker,NA,"At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they're trying to influence Washington. It's about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country . . .",Candidate,male,1,1,41
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"That's time, sir.",Moderator,female,1,1,42
Cory Booker,NA,We need to have someone that's a champion for them.,Candidate,male,1,1,43
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, I mentioned you . . .",Moderator,female,1,1,44
Savannah Guthrie,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,1,45
Savannah Guthrie,NA,Are you picking winners and losers?,Moderator,female,1,1,46
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So the way I understand this, it's there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country. That hurts workers. It hurts small businesses. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall.",Candidate,female,1,1,47
Elizabeth Warren,NA,And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy.,Candidate,female,1,1,48
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Now, look, we've had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What's been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants. That's part of the corruption in this system.",Candidate,female,1,1,49
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.",Candidate,female,1,1,50
Savannah Guthrie,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,1,1,51
Savannah Guthrie,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,1,52
Lester Holt,NA,"Secretary Castro, the next question is for you. Democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades. What would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country?",Moderator,male,1,1,53
Julian Castro,NA,"Thank you very much for that question, Lester. You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent. And I know what it's like to struggle. I know what it's like to rent a home and to worry about whether you're going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they're women.",Candidate,male,1,1,54
Julian Castro,NA,"I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,55
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,56
Julian Castro,NA,And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. It's past time that we did that.,Candidate,male,1,1,57
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,58
Julian Castro,NA,"And, you know, we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.",Candidate,male,1,1,59
Lester Holt,NA,"All right, thank you. I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard. Your thoughts on equal pay?",Moderator,male,1,1,60
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"First of all, let's recognize the situation we're in, that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful. That's not what we have right now.",Candidate,female,1,1,61
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I enlisted in the Army National Guard after the Al Qaida terror attacks on 9/11 so I could go after those who had attacked us on that day. I still serve as a major. I served over 16 years, deployed twice to the Middle East, and in Congress served on the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Affairs for over six years.",Candidate,female,1,1,62
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I know the importance of our national security, as well as the terribly high cost of war. And for too long, our leaders have failed us, taking us from one regime change war to the next, leading us into a new cold war and arms race, costing us trillions of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives.",Candidate,female,1,1,63
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This insanity must end. As president, I will take your hard-earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs, things like health care, a green economy, good-paying jobs, protecting our environment, and so much more.",Candidate,female,1,1,64
Tulsi Gabbard,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,65
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Mayor De Blasio, good evening. You're the mayor of the biggest city in the United States, but it's also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor. How would you address income inequality?",Moderator,male,1,1,66
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Well, we've been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people's lives.",Candidate,male,1,1,67
Bill de Blasio,NA,"But let me tell you, what we're hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear. This is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we're supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy. Yes, we're supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when they're not serving our democracy.",Candidate,male,1,1,68
Bill de Blasio,NA,"This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive. And in New York, we've proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people. And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there's not enough money. What I say to them every single time is, there's plenty of money in this world, there's plenty of money in this country. It's just in the wrong hands. Democrats have to fix that. (APPLAUSE)",Candidate,male,1,1,69
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Congressman Delaney, do you agree?",Moderator,male,1,1,70
John Delaney,NA,"I think we have to do real things to help American workers and the American people. Right? This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage. And I've called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers.",Candidate,male,1,1,71
John Delaney,NA,"Then we've got to fix our public education system. It's not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that.",Candidate,male,1,1,72
John Delaney,NA,"You know, I'm very different than everyone else here on the stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small- to mid-sized businesses all over the country, 5,000 of them I supported. The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities.",Candidate,male,1,1,73
John Delaney,NA,"I know how to create jobs. We need a short-term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we're creating jobs everywhere in this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,74
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Thank you. Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?",Moderator,male,1,1,75
Jay Inslee,NA,"Well, I'm a little bit surprised. I think plans are great, but I'm a governor. And we've got to realize the people who brought us the weekend, unions, need - are going to bring us a long overdue raise in America.",Candidate,male,1,1,76
Jay Inslee,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,77
Jay Inslee,NA,"And I'm proud of standing up for unions. I've got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally. I marched with the SEIU folks. It is not right that the CEO of McDonald's makes 2,100 times more than the people slinging hash at McDonald's.",Candidate,male,1,1,78
Jay Inslee,NA,"And the next thing I'll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future. Look it, Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs. And we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future.",Candidate,male,1,1,79
Jay Inslee,NA,"Carpenters, IBEW members, machinists, we're doing it in my state today. And then we can do what America always does: lead the world and invent the future and put people to work. That's what we're going to do . . .",Candidate,male,1,1,80
Jay Inslee,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,81
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"So, Congressman Ryan, President Trump, and you just referred to him, promise of manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of Ohio. Can you make that same promise?",Moderator,male,1,1,82
Tim Ryan,NA,"Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let's say the president came, he said don't sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio. And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 - 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility. That rippled throughout our community. General Motors got a tax cut. General Motors got a bailout. And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they're going to produce to Mexico.",Candidate,male,1,1,83
Tim Ryan,NA,"I've had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China. My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we're talking about here, it's been going on 40 years. This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.",Candidate,male,1,1,84
Tim Ryan,NA,"The bottom 60 percent haven't seen a raise since 1980. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth. We need an industrial policy saying we're going to dominate building electric vehicles, there's going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years. I want half of them made in the United States. I want to dominate the solar industry . . .",Candidate,male,1,1,85
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,1,1,86
Tim Ryan,NA,. . . and manufacture those here in the United States.,Candidate,male,1,1,87
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Senator Warren, are they coming back? Are these jobs coming back?",Moderator,male,1,1,88
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So we've had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it's basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they're going to do it.",Candidate,female,1,1,89
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So here's what I propose for an industrial policy. Start with a place where there's a real need. There's going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water. And we can be the ones to provide that. We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward.",Candidate,female,1,1,90
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,91
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research. They can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America.",Candidate,female,1,1,92
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And then we have to double down and sell it around the world. There's a $23 trillion market coming for green products. We should be the leaders and the owners, and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing jobs here in America.",Candidate,female,1,1,93
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,1,1,94
Elizabeth Warren,NA,We can do this.,Candidate,female,1,1,95
Lester Holt,NA,"All right. We're going to turn to the issue of health care right now and really try to understand where there may or may not be daylight between you. Many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan? Just a show of hands, start off with.",Moderator,male,1,1,96
Lester Holt,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,97
Lester Holt,NA,"All right, well, Senator Klobuchar, let me put the question to you. You're one of the Democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government health care plan. Why is an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overhaul?",Moderator,male,1,1,98
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, I think it's a bold approach. It's something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act. And that is a public option.",Candidate,female,1,1,99
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says. So let me go on beyond that.",Candidate,female,1,1,100
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals. The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people's heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.",Candidate,female,1,1,101
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that's what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it.",Candidate,female,1,1,102
Amy Klobuchar,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,103
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. And pharma thinks they own Washington? Well, they don't own me.",Candidate,female,1,1,104
Lester Holt,NA,Your time is up. Thank you.,Moderator,male,1,1,105
Lester Holt,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,106
Lester Holt,NA,"Senator Warren, you signed on to Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan. It would put essentially everybody on Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage. Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?",Moderator,male,1,1,107
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, yes. I'm with Bernie on Medicare for all. And let me tell you why.",Candidate,female,1,1,108
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke. And one of the number-one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. And that's not just for people who don't have insurance. It's for people who have insurance.",Candidate,female,1,1,109
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look at the business model of an insurance company. It's to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for all solves that problem.",Candidate,female,1,1,110
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And I understand. There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights...",Candidate,female,1,1,111
Elizabeth Warren,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,112
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,113
Lester Holt,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance. This year, you're saying you're no longer sure. Can you explain why?",Moderator,male,1,1,114
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he'd been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, he was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated -- because he doesn't have health care -- he'll be dead before the age of 40.",Candidate,male,1,1,115
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"So getting to guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal. The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, to be -- the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today.",Candidate,male,1,1,116
Beto O'Rourke,NA,And health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible.,Candidate,male,1,1,117
Beto O'Rourke,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,118
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Our plan says that if you're uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you're insufficiently insured, you can't afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you're a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you're able to keep it.",Candidate,male,1,1,119
Lester Holt,NA,Your time is up.,Moderator,male,1,1,120
Beto O'Rourke,NA,We preserve choice by making sure everybody has care.,Candidate,male,1,1,121
Lester Holt,NA,"Your time is up, Congressman, but I do want to ask a follow-up on this. Just to be very clear -- I'll give you 10 seconds -- would you replace private insurance?",Moderator,male,1,1,122
Beto O'Rourke,NA,No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for...,Candidate,male,1,1,123
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Wait, wait, wait. Congressman O'Rourke, Congressman O'Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses. It's not working. How can you defend a system that's not working?",Candidate,male,1,1,124
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"That's right. So for those for whom it's not working, they can choose Medicare. For the...",Candidate,male,1,1,125
Beto O'Rourke,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,126
Bill de Blasio,NA,Congressman...,Candidate,male,1,1,127
Beto O'Rourke,NA,... who I listen to...,Candidate,male,1,1,128
Bill de Blasio,NA,... you've got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people.,Candidate,male,1,1,129
Beto O'Rourke,NA,... they're able to keep them.,Candidate,male,1,1,130
Bill de Blasio,NA,Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?,Candidate,male,1,1,131
John Delaney,NA,"... 100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans -- I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what's working and fixes what's broken.",Candidate,male,1,1,132
John Delaney,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,133
John Delaney,NA,"I mean, doesn't that make sense? I mean, we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?",Candidate,male,1,1,134
John Delaney,NA,"And also it's bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close.",Candidate,male,1,1,135
John Delaney,NA,"And the Medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. So to some extent, we're supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing. I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right?",Candidate,male,1,1,136
John Delaney,NA,"I actually grew up in a working-class family. He loved the health care that the IBEW gave him. And I just always think about my dad in anything I would do from a policy perspective. He'd look at me and he'd say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American. But why are you taking my health care away?",Candidate,male,1,1,137
Lester Holt,NA,"I've let this -- I've let this play out a little bit because I'm fascinated to hear the daylight between you. Congresswoman Gabbard, why don't you weigh in here?",Moderator,male,1,1,138
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I think we're talking about this in the wrong way. You're talking about one bill over another bill. Really, what we're talking about is our objective, making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the health care that they need.",Candidate,female,1,1,139
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I believe Medicare for all is the way to do that. I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for all program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need.",Candidate,female,1,1,140
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,I also think that...,Candidate,female,1,1,141

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"... if you -- if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance, so I think that's what we've got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need, regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.",Candidate,female,1,1,143
Lester Holt,NA,"Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thanks.",Moderator,male,1,1,144
Lester Holt,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,145
Lester Holt,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,146
Lester Holt,NA,"Let me turn to Senator Booker on this. Senator Booker, explain to me where you are. This is hugely important to people. So tell us where you are.",Moderator,male,1,1,147
Cory Booker,NA,"I absolutely will. First of all, we're talking about this as a health care issue, but in communities like mine, low-income communities, it's an education issue, because kids who don't have health care are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs and employment, because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work. It's even a retirement issue, because in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care.",Candidate,male,1,1,148
Cory Booker,NA,"And so where I stand is very clear. Health care -- it's not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for all.",Candidate,male,1,1,149
Cory Booker,NA,"But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I'm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. And on this debate, I'm sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers.",Candidate,male,1,1,150
Cory Booker,NA,"Literally, the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare's overhead is only at 2 percent. We can do this better. And every single day, I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal...",Candidate,male,1,1,151
Lester Holt,NA,"Your time is up, Senator.",Moderator,male,1,1,152
Cory Booker,NA,... which is every American having health care.,Candidate,male,1,1,153
Cory Booker,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,154
Lester Holt,NA,"Time is up, Senator. I want to...",Moderator,male,1,1,155
Lester Holt,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,156
Lester Holt,NA,"I want to move back, if I can, to Congresswoman Gabbard...",Moderator,male,1,1,157
Lester Holt,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,158
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"... point, though, and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion. And that doesn't count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington.",Candidate,female,1,1,159
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is, because it's not working for families, but it's sure as heck working for them.",Candidate,female,1,1,160
Elizabeth Warren,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,161
Elizabeth Warren,NA,It's time for us to make families come first.,Candidate,female,1,1,162
Jay Inslee,NA,It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.,Candidate,male,1,1,163
Jay Inslee,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,164
Jay Inslee,NA,"And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman's right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I'm the only candidate who has passed a public option. And I respect everybody's goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that's actually advanced the ball. And we've got to have access for everyone. I've done it as a public option.",Candidate,male,1,1,165
Lester Holt,NA,Your time...,Moderator,male,1,1,166
Lester Holt,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,167
Lester Holt,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, I want to get you...",Moderator,male,1,1,168
Lester Holt,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,169
Unknown,NA,That's a false claim.,Moderator,unknown,1,1,170
Lester Holt,NA,I am fascinated by this. Senator -- Senator Klobuchar?,Moderator,male,1,1,171
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I just want to say, there's three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose. I'll start with that.",Candidate,female,1,1,172
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,173
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care. And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way. And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered.",Candidate,female,1,1,174
Amy Klobuchar,NA,So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.,Candidate,female,1,1,175
Amy Klobuchar,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,176
Lester Holt,NA,"Secretary Castro, this one is for you. All of you on stage support a woman's right to an abortion. You all support some version of a government health care option. Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?",Moderator,male,1,1,177
Julian Castro,NA,"Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice.",Candidate,male,1,1,178
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,179
Julian Castro,NA,"And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman -- or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose. And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.",Candidate,male,1,1,180
Julian Castro,NA,"More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade and will respect it...",Candidate,male,1,1,181
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,182
Julian Castro,NA,"... and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.",Candidate,male,1,1,183
Lester Holt,NA,"Senator Warren, would you put limits on -- any limits on abortion?",Moderator,male,1,1,184
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services, and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.",Candidate,female,1,1,185
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,186
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And I want to add on that. It's not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. Forty-seven years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided, and we've all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protections...",Candidate,female,1,1,187
Lester Holt,NA,"Your time is up, Senator.",Moderator,male,1,1,188
Elizabeth Warren,NA,We now have an America where most people support Roe v. Wade. We need to make that a federal law.,Candidate,female,1,1,189
Lester Holt,NA,"Senator, thank you. Jose?",Moderator,male,1,1,190
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Lester, thank you. Senator Booker, I want to kind of come back on a discussion we were having about health and the opioid crisis. You represent a state where 14 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies are based. Should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do?",Moderator,male,1,1,191
Cory Booker,NA,"They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible. This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.",Candidate,male,1,1,192
Cory Booker,NA,"And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we've tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.",Candidate,male,1,1,193
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, how would you deal with it?",Moderator,male,1,1,194
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars. It's the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it.",Candidate,male,1,1,195
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we're seeing throughout this country, they've been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail.",Candidate,male,1,1,196
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Unless there's accountability and justice, this crisis will continue. In my administration, we will hold them to account. We will make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who've been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.",Candidate,male,1,1,197
Lester Holt,NA,I know immigration is on a lot of your minds here.,Moderator,male,1,1,198
Lester Holt,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,199
Lester Holt,NA,And I want to talk about it. We're going to talk about it in a moment. We need to take a break. We'll be back with more from Miami after this.,Moderator,male,1,1,200
Lester Holt,(COMMERCIAL BREAK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,201
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"We want to turn to an issue that has been in the news, especially this week. There are undocumented children being held alone in detention, even as close as Homestead, Florida, right here, less than 30 miles from where we are tonight. Fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the United States of America.",Moderator,male,1,1,202
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"We saw that image today that broke our hearts, and they had names. Oscar Martinez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country. Last month, more than 130,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border.",Moderator,male,1,1,203
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Secretary Castro, if you were president today, hoy, what would you specifically do?",Moderator,male,1,1,204
Julian Castro,NA,"Thank you very much, Jose. I'm very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan. And we saw those images...",Candidate,male,1,1,205
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,206
Julian Castro,NA,"... watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off.",Candidate,male,1,1,207
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,208
Julian Castro,NA,"If I were president today -- and it should spur us to action. If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump's zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy -- this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.",Candidate,male,1,1,209
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"On day one. Sorry, I'm just going to ask...",Moderator,male,1,1,210
Jose Diaz-Balart,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,211
Julian Castro,NA,"On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering. And then I would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven't committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship.",Candidate,male,1,1,212
Julian Castro,NA,"And then we'd get to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.",Candidate,male,1,1,213
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,214
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Senator Booker, what would you do on day one? And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.",Moderator,male,1,1,215
Cory Booker,NA,"Yes. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) On day one, I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border Policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border.",Candidate,male,1,1,216
Cory Booker,NA,Number two...,Candidate,male,1,1,217
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,218
Cory Booker,NA,".... I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here.",Candidate,male,1,1,219
Cory Booker,NA,"And then, finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and think that we're going to get border security. We actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both.",Candidate,male,1,1,220
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,221
Cory Booker,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,222
Julian Castro,NA,"... if I might -- if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point. You know, my plan -- and I'm glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this. My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.",Candidate,male,1,1,223
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,224
Julian Castro,NA,"And here's why it's important. We see all of this horrendous family separation. They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.",Candidate,male,1,1,225
Unknown,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,unknown,1,1,226
Unknown,NA,Jose...,Moderator,unknown,1,1,227
Julian Castro,NA,And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.,Candidate,male,1,1,228
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,229
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,Thirty seconds.,Moderator,male,1,1,230
Cory Booker,NA,"As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue, but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn't just go on at our border. It happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work. We must end those policies, as well.",Candidate,male,1,1,231
Cory Booker,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,232
Bill de Blasio,NA,We have to change the discussion about in this country...,Candidate,male,1,1,233
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,Mayor?,Moderator,male,1,1,234
Bill de Blasio,NA,"... because look at the bottom line here. Those tragic -- that tragic photo of those -- that parent, that child -- and I'm saying this as a father. Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values.",Candidate,male,1,1,235
Bill de Blasio,NA,"But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we're not being honest about the division that's been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you're falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn't do that to you.",Candidate,male,1,1,236
Bill de Blasio,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,237
Bill de Blasio,NA,"The big corporations did that to you. The 1 percent did that to you. We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants. But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we're going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with. And remind people we're all in this together.",Candidate,male,1,1,238
Bill de Blasio,NA,"If we don't change that debate, that politics that's holding us back, we won't get all these reforms people are talking about. That's what we need to do as Democrats.",Candidate,male,1,1,239
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"If I could, I'm sorry. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House??",Moderator,male,1,1,240
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) We would not turn back Valeria and her father, Oscar. We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws. We would not build walls. We would not put kids in cages. In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already...",Candidate,male,1,1,241
Beto O'Rourke,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,242

Jose Diaz-Balart,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,248
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,But let him finish. Let him finish.,Moderator,male,1,1,249
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We would not detain any family fleeing violence, in fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today. We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost. And then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, free Dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there's no reason to make that 2,000 mile journey to this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,250

Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Secretary, I'll give you 30 seconds.",Moderator,male,1,1,253
Julian Castro,NA,Let's be very clear. The reason that they're separating these little children from their families is that they're using Section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them.,Candidate,male,1,1,254
Julian Castro,NA,"Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O'Rourke, have not. And I want to challenge all of the candidate to do that.",Candidate,male,1,1,255

Julian Castro,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,257

Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,1,1,259
Jose Diaz-Balart,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,260
Julian Castro,NA,... then it might as well be the same policy.,Candidate,male,1,1,261
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Let me respond to this very briefly. As a member of a Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don't criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,262
Julian Castro,NA,I'm not talking about -- I'm not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.,Candidate,male,1,1,263
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"If you're fleeing -- if you're fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure...",Candidate,male,1,1,264
Julian Castro,NA,I'm talking about -- I'm talking about everybody else.,Candidate,male,1,1,265
Beto O'Rourke,NA,... I want to make sure you are treated with respect.,Candidate,male,1,1,266
Julian Castro,NA,I'm still talking about everybody else.,Candidate,male,1,1,267
Beto O'Rourke,NA,But you're looking at just one small part of this. I'm talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.,Candidate,male,1,1,268
Julian Castro,NA,That's not true.,Candidate,male,1,1,269
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,270
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And if you do that, I don't think it's asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,271
Julian Castro,NA,"That's actually not true. I'm talking about millions of folks -- a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum. A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right? And you said recently that the reason you didn't want to repeal Section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking.",Candidate,male,1,1,272
Julian Castro,NA,"But let me tell you what: Section 18, title 18 of the U.S. code, title 21 and title 22, already cover human trafficking.",Candidate,male,1,1,273
Julian Castro,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,274

Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Let's -- Lester -- Lester -- I'm sorry, Savannah -- I know, it's just -- we could go on.",Moderator,male,1,1,279
John Delaney,NA,"But rather than talk about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country...",Candidate,male,1,1,280

Amy Klobuchar,NA,Yes.,Candidate,female,1,1,285
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Let's talk about what Secretary Castro just said. He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border. Do you support that? Do you think it should be a civil offense only? And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?",Moderator,female,1,1,286
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Immigrants, they do not diminish America. They are America. And I am happy to look at his proposal. But I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.",Candidate,female,1,1,287
Amy Klobuchar,NA,What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here. And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries. Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries.,Candidate,female,1,1,288
Amy Klobuchar,NA,We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories. We need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas.,Candidate,female,1,1,289
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants. And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible and get it done. It brings the doubt down by $158 billion.",Candidate,female,1,1,290
Savannah Guthrie,NA,Senator...,Moderator,female,1,1,291
Amy Klobuchar,NA,It gives a path for citizenship for citizen -- for people who can become citizens. And it will be so much better for our economy in America.,Candidate,female,1,1,292

Tim Ryan,NA,"Well, I agree with Secretary Castro. I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they're dealing drugs and other things. That's already established in the law. So there's no need to repeat it.",Candidate,male,1,1,296
Tim Ryan,NA,"And I think it's abhorrent -- we're talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here -- the way these kids are being treated. If you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States. That needs to stop.",Candidate,male,1,1,297
Tim Ryan,NA,"And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids. What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who's so focused on hate and fear and division? And what has happened now, the end result is now we've got kids literally laying in their own snot, with three-week-old diapers that haven't been changed.",Candidate,male,1,1,298

Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Senator Booker -- a lot of people -- they asked the question, if you're president on day one, what will you do with the fact that you will have families here? There's been a lot of talk about what you'll do in the first 100 days about legislation. What will you actually do with these families? How will you care for them? Will they be detained or will they not be?",Moderator,female,1,1,302
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, this is a related and brief point, because what we're talking -- what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process.",Candidate,male,1,1,303
Cory Booker,NA,"I have been to some of the largest private prisons, which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration, and their immigration lockups. Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it's immigration, whether it's mental illness, whether it's addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem.",Candidate,male,1,1,304
Cory Booker,NA,"Donald Trump isn't solving this problem. We've seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the Northern Triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here, because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.",Candidate,male,1,1,305
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,306

Jay Inslee,NA,And we should do what we're doing in Washington state. I'm proud that we've passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini-ICE agents.,Candidate,male,1,1,312
Jay Inslee,NA,"I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's heinous Muslim ban. I'm proud to be a person who's not only talked about Dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education, so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state.",Candidate,male,1,1,313
Jay Inslee,NA,"And I'll leave you with this thought, if you want to know what I think. Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me -- he thought it was a threat -- to tell me that he would send refugees into Washington state if we passed a law that I passed. And I told him that's not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity as a strength. This is how we've built America.

Lester Holt,NA,"We're going to -- we're going to talk about Iran right now, because we're working against the clock. Tankers have been attacked. A U.S. drone has been shot down. There have been disturbing threats issued by both the U.S. and Iranian leadership.",Moderator,male,1,1,320
Lester Holt,NA,"I'd like if you can, just for a moment, to put aside how you think we may have gotten here, but what I want to know is, how do you dial it back? So a show of hands. Who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated? That's every -- well, Senator Booker, why not?",Moderator,male,1,1,321
Lester Holt,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,322
Cory Booker,NA,"May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we're seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled -- being pulled further and further into this crisis.",Candidate,male,1,1,323
Cory Booker,NA,"We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I'm not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I'm going to rejoin that deal. Because when I'm president of the United States, I'm going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I'm going to do it.",Candidate,male,1,1,324
Cory Booker,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,325
Lester Holt,NA,"All right, Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to ask you to answer that question, because you've said -- you've said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement. Can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?",Moderator,male,1,1,326
Unknown,NA,"Yes, it was.",Moderator,unknown,1,1,327
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that's something we could negotiate, to get back in the deal.",Candidate,female,1,1,328
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians, who claim now that they're going blow the caps on enriching uranium. And the Iranians have told us this.",Candidate,female,1,1,329
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And so that's where we are now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president. So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done.",Candidate,female,1,1,330
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And then, finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict -- and we're having this debate in Congress right now -- that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that.",Candidate,female,1,1,331

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Let's deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran.",Candidate,female,1,1,338
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms' lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives. It would exacerbate the refugee crisis.",Candidate,female,1,1,339
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"And it wouldn't be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war. This is why it's so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say no war with Iran. We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it.",Candidate,female,1,1,340
Tulsi Gabbard,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,341
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"It was an imperfect deal. There are issues, like their missile development, that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.",Candidate,female,1,1,342
Lester Holt,NA,Your time is up. And this is a very quick follow-up. But what would your red line be that would -- for military action against Iran?,Moderator,male,1,1,343
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Look, obviously, if there was an attack against the American -- our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is -- and it's important for us to recognize this -- is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others -- are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That's why we need to de-escalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride, put the American people first.",Candidate,female,1,1,344

Rachel Maddow,NA,Good.,Moderator,female,1,1,360
Chuck Todd,NA,"And we've got a lot of ground to cover. We're going to be talking about guns and climate here up top. A whole lot more in this hour. Obviously, because of the size of the field, not every person will be able to weigh in on everything, but over the course of this next hour, we will hear from everyone, I promise, everybody.",Moderator,male,1,1,361
Chuck Todd,NA,"And to begin with, we're going to go with guns, and, Senator Warren, I want to start with you. We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since. Many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban, but even if implemented, there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country. Should there be a role for the federal government?",Moderator,male,1,1,362

Chuck Todd,NA,"So the question is simply this. We're from -- I apologize you guys didn't get to hear this, the first part of the question. Obviously, we're not far from Parkland, Florida. Gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in Broward County.",Moderator,male,1,1,368
Chuck Todd,NA,"Many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions. Some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban. But even if it's put in place, there are still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns still on the streets. Is there a role for the federal government in order to -- to play in order to get these guns off the streets?",Moderator,male,1,1,369
Chuck Todd,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,370

Chuck Todd,NA,Never say never. But we will march forward here and I will lean forward here a little bit.,Moderator,male,1,1,381
Chuck Todd,NA,"Senator Warren, we're going to get to the gun question here. In Parkland, Florida, it's just north of here in Broward County. As you know, it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue. It has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns, including assault weapons ban, but even if you're able to implement that, what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there? And does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it?",Moderator,male,1,1,382
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, in this period of time that I have been running for president, I've had more than 100 town halls. I've taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions. And the single hardest questions I've gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl, and that is to say, when you're president, how are you going to keep us safe?",Candidate,female,1,1,383
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"That's our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers. And they won't just die in mass shootings. They'll die on sidewalks, they'll die in playgrounds, they'll die in people's backyards.",Candidate,female,1,1,384
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country. And we need to treat it like that.,Candidate,female,1,1,385
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,1,386
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So what can we do? We can do the things that are sensible. We can do the universal background checks. We can ban the weapons of war. But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe. We need to treat this like the virus that's killing our children.",Candidate,female,1,1,387
Chuck Todd,NA,"OK, thank you, Senator Warren. You didn't address -- do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?",Moderator,male,1,1,388
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done. You know, guns in the hands of a collector who's had them for decades, who's never fired them, who takes safety seriously, that's very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly.",Candidate,female,1,1,389
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can't treat this as an across-the-board problem. We have to treat it like a public health emergency. That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether it's politically popular or not.",Candidate,female,1,1,390
Chuck Todd,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker, you have a program...",Moderator,male,1,1,391

Chuck Todd,NA,"Senator Booker, you have a federal government buyback program in your plan. How is that going to work?",Moderator,male,1,1,394
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, I want to say, my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But what's even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I'm the only one -- I hope I'm the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year.",Candidate,male,1,1,395
Cory Booker,NA,"For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue. This is an urgency. And for those that have not been directly affected, they're tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school.",Candidate,male,1,1,396
Cory Booker,NA,"This is something that I'm tired of. And I'm tired of hearing people all, they have to offer is thoughts and prayers.",Candidate,male,1,1,397
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,398
Cory Booker,NA,"In my faith, people say faith without works is dead. So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal.",Candidate,male,1,1,399
Chuck Todd,NA,"Thank you, Senator Booker.",Moderator,male,1,1,400
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Secretary Castro, I'd like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools, as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now. They don't make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll.",Moderator,female,1,1,401
Rachel Maddow,NA,"As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes? Or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?",Moderator,female,1,1,402
Julian Castro,NA,"You know, Rachel, I am the dad of a 10-year-old girl, Carina, who's here tonight. And the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that's supposed to be safe.",Candidate,male,1,1,403
Julian Castro,NA,"The answer to your question is no. We don't have to accept that. And I believe that, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we're going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.",Candidate,male,1,1,404
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,405

Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,407
Julian Castro,NA,"... you know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we're getting closer. The House took a vote. In the Senate, the question often is, if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing commonsense gun reform, I'm going to choose commonsense gun reform. So I believe that we're going to be able to get that done in 2021.",Candidate,male,1,1,408
Chuck Todd,NA,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",Moderator,male,1,1,409
Tim Ryan,NA,"Rachel, I have something to add to this briefly, because...",Candidate,male,1,1,410
Rachel Maddow,NA,We'll give you -- it'll be 30 seconds for a follow-up on that question -- on that answer from Secretary Castro. Congressman Ryan?,Moderator,female,1,1,411
Tim Ryan,NA,You're talking about in the schools. These kids are traumatized. I support all the gun reforms here. We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have. We need trauma-based care in every school. We need social and emotional learning in every school.,Candidate,male,1,1,412
Tim Ryan,NA,"Ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they're in, and 73 percent of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied. We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school. That means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States. We need to start playing offense. If our kids are so traumatized that they're getting a gun and going into our schools, we're doing something wrong, too, and we need reform around trauma-based care.",Candidate,male,1,1,413
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Thank you, Congressman Ryan.",Moderator,female,1,1,414
Chuck Todd,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, you're a Texan who's campaigned -- you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there. What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else, OK, but says, you know what, the Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they're going to take my gun away, and even though I agree with you on all these other issues -- how do you have that conversation?",Moderator,male,1,1,415
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Here's how we have that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe high school shooting, a young student named Bree. Her friend, Marcel, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks, where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives.",Candidate,male,1,1,416
Beto O'Rourke,NA,We talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.,Candidate,male,1,1,417
Beto O'Rourke,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,418
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they're stopped before it's too late. And what I found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun-owners and non-gun-owners alike, agreed.",Candidate,male,1,1,419
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they've been able to change those laws. They're making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.",Candidate,male,1,1,420

Chuck Todd,NA,"Hang on. Let me give 30 seconds, Senator Klobuchar, the iron range. I'm curious. Gun confiscation, right? If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?",Moderator,male,1,1,424
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, that's not confiscation. You could give them the offer to buy back their gun.",Candidate,female,1,1,425
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But I'll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand, coming from a proud hunting and fishing state? These proposals don't do that.",Candidate,female,1,1,426
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapons ban. When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change, and we all failed. And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift.",Candidate,female,1,1,427
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"You know why? It's just like with gay marriage. When kids talked to their parents and their grandparents, they say I don't understand why we can't put these sensible things in place, they listen. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year-olds...",Candidate,female,1,1,428

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Mitch McConnell says that his most consequential achievement as Senate majority leader was preventing President Obama from filling a Supreme Court seat. Having served with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, do you believe they would confirm your court nominees?",Moderator,female,1,1,435
Cory Booker,NA,"I'm going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there's one thing we don't all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it's common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me. If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm.",Candidate,male,1,1,436
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,437
Cory Booker,NA,"And not everybody in this field agrees with that. But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns.",Candidate,male,1,1,438
Cory Booker,NA,"When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we -- I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro. We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate. This is a team sport. Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there.",Candidate,male,1,1,439
Cory Booker,NA,"This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn't so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.",Candidate,male,1,1,440

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Congressman Delaney, I'll give you some time in a moment. Mayor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen. If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?",Moderator,female,1,1,449
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation's largest city, and I also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question.",Candidate,male,1,1,450
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Look, I run the largest police force in America, too, and if we're going to stop these shootings, we want to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community.",Candidate,male,1,1,451
Bill de Blasio,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,452
Bill de Blasio,NA,"I also want to say there's something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is, for the last 21 years, I have been raising a black son in America. And I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son, Dante, about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police, too, as we saw recently in Indiana.",Candidate,male,1,1,453
Bill de Blasio,NA,"So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together. We've done that in New York City and we've driven down crime while we've done it.",Candidate,male,1,1,454
Bill de Blasio,NA,"But to your question about Mitch McConnell, there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with. If the Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again, and go into states, including red states, to convince people we're on their side, we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward...",Candidate,male,1,1,455

Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell if you don't beat him in the Senate, if he's still sitting there as the Senate majority leader?

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We are democracy. And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters. Now, we have for far too long have had a Congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country.",Candidate,female,1,1,464
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"They have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people.",Candidate,female,1,1,465
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Well, here's how I see this happening. Number one, sure, I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the Senate. But short of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on. It starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come January 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.",Candidate,female,1,1,466

John Delaney,NA,I think we need to get things done. That's why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner.,Candidate,male,1,1,470
John Delaney,NA,"Listen, I will sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party-line basis, absolutely. But all the big transformative things we've ever done in this country's history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions, not impossible promises.",Candidate,male,1,1,471
John Delaney,NA,"We need to put forth ideas that work, whether it's on health care, creating universal health care so that every American gets health care, but not running on making private insurance illegal.",Candidate,male,1,1,472
John Delaney,NA,"The gun issue is related. The gun safety issue is related, because I can't tell you how many times I've been with folks in Western Maryland, and they've said to me, you know, Democrats don't do anything for us, Republicans don't do anything for us.

Cory Booker,NA,"You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African-American man in an African-American-dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform, from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.",Candidate,male,1,1,481
Cory Booker,NA,"And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done.

Jay Inslee,NA,"And we have to understand, this is a climate crisis, an emergency (OFF-MIKE) this is our last chance in the administration, next one, to do something about it.

And my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work.",Candidate,male,1,1,497
Jay Inslee,NA,"But the most important thing on this, in the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority? And I am the candidate and the only one who's saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what we've always done, lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa. And every home in that community had flooded.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We're going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years. We're going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels, and we're going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver's seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide.",Candidate,male,1,1,505

Chuck Todd,NA,"Thirty seconds, Secretary Castro, does -- who pays for the mitigation to -- to climate, whether it's building sea walls, for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn't be living? Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? What do you do about that, where maybe they're building a place someplace that isn't safe? Who pays to build that house? And how much should the government be bailing them out?",Moderator,male,1,1,507
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, I don't think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn't to Iowa or New Hampshire. It was to San Juan, Puerto Rico.",Candidate,male,1,1,508

Julian Castro,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,514
Chuck Todd,NA,"All right. Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this. There are -- a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way. This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it's Washington state where voters voted it down, you've had the Yellow Vest Movement, we had in Australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer. If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?",Moderator,male,1,1,515
Tim Ryan,NA,"Well, there is a variety of different ways to pay. We talked about different ways of raising revenue. And I think we've got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this.",Candidate,male,1,1,516
Tim Ryan,NA,"But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics. We could talk about climate, we could talk about guns, we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about.",Candidate,male,1,1,517
Tim Ryan,NA,"We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party. We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We've lost all connection. We have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elital -- elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years, to get those workers back on our side so we can say we're going to build electric vehicles, we're going to build solar panels.",Candidate,male,1,1,518
Tim Ryan,NA,"But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working-class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out, and if you want to take Lindsey Graham out, you've got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina.

One of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the LGBT community about your past stances and statements on gay rights.

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you. On the issue of civil rights, for decades -- on the civil rights and demographics, honestly, and politics, for decades, the Democratic Party has counted on African-American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level. Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way. What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you're your party's nominee?",Moderator,female,1,1,561
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity. And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work. And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs.",Candidate,female,1,1,562
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead Democrat -- OK, that's a first up here -- was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs.",Candidate,female,1,1,563
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So to me, this is about a few things. It's about an African-American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. It's about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes.",Candidate,female,1,1,564

Rachel Maddow,NA,"That's time, Senator.",Moderator,female,1,1,566

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator, thank you very much. Thirty-second follow-up to you, Secretary Castro. This is a 70 percent Latino city here in Miami. You are the only Latino Democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race.",Moderator,female,1,1,568
Rachel Maddow,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,1,569
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Is that enough of an answer, what Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda? Is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?",Moderator,female,1,1,570
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice. And, you know, I was in Charleston not too long ago, and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emanuel AME church, and he murdered nine people who were worshipping, and then he was apprehended by police without incident.",Candidate,male,1,1,571
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio Arce?

Chuck Todd,NA,"Let me go over to Lester Holt, who's got a question, I believe a viewer question.",Moderator,male,1,1,574
Lester Holt,NA,"And I'm over here, Chuck. Thanks. We asked voters from across the country to submit their questions to the candidates. Let me read one now. This comes from John in New York who submitted this question.",Moderator,male,1,1,575
Lester Holt,NA,"He asks, does the United States have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity? Do we have a responsibility to intervene to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect American core interests? I would like to direct that question to Congressman O'Rourke.",Moderator,male,1,1,576
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"John, appreciate the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.",Candidate,male,1,1,577
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He's diminished our standing in the world and he's made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it's Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.",Candidate,male,1,1,578
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"He's embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together. That makes America stronger.",Candidate,male,1,1,579

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, thank you.",Moderator,female,1,1,582
Bill de Blasio,NA,"What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation? With deep respect to the congressman, look, we've learned painful lessons as Americans that we've gone to war without congressional authorization.",Candidate,male,1,1,583
Bill de Blasio,NA,"And look, this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the U.S. Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off, and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life. And that battle didn't kill him, but that war did.",Candidate,male,1,1,584
Bill de Blasio,NA,"And, look, even in the humanitarian crisis -- and I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene, God forbid there is genocide -- but not without congressional approval. Democrats and Republicans both in the Congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval. We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten, that decisions have to be made by the United States Congress...",Candidate,male,1,1,585
Bill de Blasio,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,1,1,586
Rachel Maddow,NA,"I'm going to pick up -- I want to pick up this point, and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan. Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American service members in Afghanistan. Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said that they want to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn't over for America. Why isn't it over? Why can't presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there? And how could you?",Moderator,female,1,1,587
Tim Ryan,NA,"I appreciate that question. So I've been in Congress 17 years. And 12 of those years I've sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee.",Candidate,male,1,1,588
Tim Ryan,NA,"And the lesson that I've learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it. It's long. It's tedious. But right now, we have -- so I would say we must be engaged in this. We must have our State Department engaged. We must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be.",Candidate,male,1,1,589
Tim Ryan,NA,"But the reality of it is, this president doesn't even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things, whether we're talking about Central America, whether we're talking about Iran, whether we're talking about Afghanistan. We've got to be completely engaged.",Candidate,male,1,1,590
Tim Ryan,NA,"And here's why, because these flare-ups distract us from the real problems in the country. If we're getting drones shot down for $130 million, because the president is distracted, that's $130 million that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio, or Flint, Michigan, or rebuilding -- or rebuilding...",Candidate,male,1,1,591

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began.

Chuck Todd,NA,"All right. Well, thank you for that wide variety of answers, and I mean that. No, I mean that in -- that's what this debate is about. This is the best part of a debate like this.",Moderator,male,1,1,647
Chuck Todd,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump. House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House. If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller's report?",Moderator,male,1,1,648
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yes, and I'll tell you why.",Candidate,male,1,1,649
Chuck Todd,NA,"How, by the way? If the answer is yes.",Moderator,male,1,1,650
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States Capitol is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power, submitting to the rule of law and the will of people. That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.",Candidate,male,1,1,651
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard, and that is that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law. And we cannot allow that to stand.",Candidate,male,1,1,652
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy. And if we've not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows, and under my administration, our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice. It's the only way that we save this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,653

Chuck Todd,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,1,655
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O'Rourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the House, it raises the prospect -- and the Mueller Report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line. No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?",Moderator,female,1,1,656
John Delaney,NA,I guess there's always a first.,Candidate,male,1,1,657
Rachel Maddow,NA,Should he be?,Moderator,female,1,1,658
John Delaney,NA,"I don't think anyone is above the law. I don't think anyone is above the law, including a president. I support Speaker Pelosi's decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker. I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined.",Candidate,male,1,1,659
Rachel Maddow,NA,Conceded. On the issue of prosecution...,Moderator,female,1,1,660
John Delaney,NA,"So -- but I do think -- I do think the -- no one is above the law, and this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law. But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you're out doing as much campaigning as I've done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number-one issue the American people ask us about.",Candidate,male,1,1,661
John Delaney,NA,"It's not. They want to know what we're going to do for health care, how we're going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we're going to build infrastructure, what we're going to do to create jobs in their communities.",Candidate,male,1,1,662
John Delaney,NA,"You know, last year in our country, 80 percent of the money for start-up businesses went to 50 counties in this country.",Candidate,male,1,1,663
John Delaney,NA,"There's over 3,000 counties in this country. That's what they care about. They care about what's going on in the public schools.

We created the American dream for millions of people like myself, the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs.",Candidate,male,1,1,680
John Delaney,NA,"But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises. And those are the roots that we have to get back to.

Bill de Blasio,NA,It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care.

Bill de Blasio,NA,"These things really matter. And these are the things that I've done in New York and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters.

Savannah Guthrie,NA,"You've called for big, new government benefits, like universal health care and free college. In a recent interview, you said you suspected that Americans would be, quote, ""delighted"" to pay more taxes for things like that. My question to you is, will taxes go up for the middle class in a Sanders administration? And if so, how do you sell that to voters?",Moderator,female,1,2,2
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, you're quite right. We have a new vision for America. And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today, we think it is time for change, real change.",Candidate,male,1,2,3

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Under that system, by the way, vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for health care than they are right now.",Candidate,male,1,2,6

Savannah Guthrie,NA,"But let me just - Senator Biden - promise everybody's going to get in here, promise. Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, as you know, has been calling for a revolution. Recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors, as you were speaking about problem of income inequality in this country, you said we shouldn't, quote, ""demonize the rich."" You said, ""Nobody has to be punished. No one's standard of living would change. Nothing would fundamentally change."" What did you mean by that?",Moderator,female,1,2,17
Joe Biden,NA,"What I meant by that is, look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America.",Candidate,male,1,2,18
Joe Biden,NA,"Ordinary, middle-class Americans built America. My dad used to have an expression. He said, Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay.",Candidate,male,1,2,19
Joe Biden,NA,"Too many people who are at the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal. What I'm saying is that we've got to be straightforward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we have a situation where there's continuing education and they're able to pay for it. And they have to make sure that they're able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink.",Candidate,male,1,2,20
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality. And the one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cut for the wealthy.",Candidate,male,1,2,21

Savannah Guthrie,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,2,23
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"There's is a lot of talk in this primary about new government benefits, such as student loan cancellation, free college, health care, and more.

For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most, which I why I am proposing that we change the tax code, so for every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect up to $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support or not.",Candidate,female,1,2,28

Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Governor Hickenlooper, let me get you in on this. You've warned that Democrats will lose in 2020 if they ""embrace socialism,"" as you put it. You were booed at the California Democratic convention when you said that. Only one candidate on this stage, Senator Sanders, identifies himself as a democratic socialist. What are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards ""socialism""?",Moderator,female,1,2,32
John Hickenlooper,NA,"Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don't clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists.",Candidate,male,1,2,33
John Hickenlooper,NA,"And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change - I'm a scientist - but we can't promise every American a government job. If we want to get universal health care coverage, I believe that health care is a right and not a privilege, but you can't expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don't want to give it up.",Candidate,male,1,2,34
John Hickenlooper,NA,"In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together, and we got near universal health care coverage. We were the first state in America to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address - aggressively address methane emissions.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, I think the responses that the polls - last poll I saw had us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and that he lied to the American people during his campaign.",Candidate,male,1,2,41
Bernie Sanders,NA,"He said he was going to stand up for working families. Well, President Trump, you're not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So if you're talking about ending gun violence, it's the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible.

Michael Bennet,NA,"I appreciate it.

Michael Bennet,NA,"Where I disagree is on his solution of Medicare-for-all. You know, I - I have proposed getting to universal health care, which we need to do. It is a right. Health care is a right. We need to get to universal health care. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare-for-all, or whether they want to keep their private insurance.",Candidate,male,1,2,62

Eric Swalwell,NA,"You can't count on the people who have been in government for the last 30 years, who were around when this problem was created, to be the ones to solve it. It's going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can't start a family, can't take a good idea and start a business and can't buy our first home. This is the generation that's going to be able to solve student loan debt. This generation is ready to lead.",Candidate,male,1,2,95
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Mr. Yang, your - your signature policy is to give every adult in the United States $1,000 a month, no questions asked.",Moderator,male,1,2,96
Andrew Yang,NA,That's right.,Candidate,male,1,2,97
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,I think that's like $3.2 trillion a year. How would do you that?,Moderator,male,1,2,98
Andrew Yang,NA,I'm sorry?,Candidate,male,1,2,99
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,How would you do that.,Moderator,male,1,2,100
Andrew Yang,NA,"Oh, so it's difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion-dollar tech companies, paying literally zero in taxes while they're closing 30 percent of our stores.",Candidate,male,1,2,101
Andrew Yang,NA,"Now, we need to put the American people in position to benefit from all these innovations in other parts of the economy. And if we had a value-added tax at even half the European level, it would generate over $800 billion in new revenue, which combined with the money in our hands, it would be the trickle-up economy, from our people, families and communities up. We would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods, creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier.",Candidate,male,1,2,102
Andrew Yang,NA,"We'd save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room health care, and just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion.",Candidate,male,1,2,103
Andrew Yang,NA,"This is the move that we have to make, particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American jobs, it's why Donald Trump is our president today that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and we are about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck-driving jobs and other jobs through the economy.",Candidate,male,1,2,104
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"So, Mr. Yang, if I get to understand a little bit better, Sir, you are saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18, but a value-added tax so you can spend that $1,000 on value-added tax?",Moderator,male,1,2,105
Andrew Yang,NA,"Well, the value-added tax would end up - you still would be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value-added tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults, it would be $24-36,000 a year.",Candidate,male,1,2,106
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"okay. Congressman Swalwell, I want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about, and you just actually mentioned, that many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs. What would you do to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?",Moderator,male,1,2,107
Eric Swalwell,NA,"We must always be a county where technology creates more jobs than it displaces. And I have seen the anxiety across America where the manufacturing floors go from 1,000 to 100 to one. So we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it, invest in America's communities especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills.",Candidate,male,1,2,108
Eric Swalwell,NA,"But, Jose, I was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.

Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Vice President, would you like to sing a torch song?",Moderator,male,1,2,112
Jose Diaz-Balart,(LAUGHTER),NA,Moderator,male,1,2,113
Joe Biden,NA,"I would. I'm still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate - for an education. The fact is that that's why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress.",Candidate,male,1,2,114
Joe Biden,NA,"That's why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That's why I think we should have universal pre-K. That's why I think every single person who graduates from high school, 65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education.",Candidate,male,1,2,115
Joe Biden,NA,"That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen, no interest payment until they get beyond that.",Candidate,male,1,2,116
Joe Biden,NA,"We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on. And so, folks, there is a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st Century. We are not doing that now.",Candidate,male,1,2,117

Kamala Harris,NA,"You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours? And he talks about the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks.

Lester Holt,NA,"And this is going to be a show of hands question. We asked a question about health care last night that spurred a lot of discussion, as you know. We're going to do it again now. Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favorite of a government-run plan?",Moderator,male,1,2,142

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"Yeah, so now it's my turn.",Candidate,female,1,2,146
Michael Bennet,NA,Good.,Candidate,male,1,2,147
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So this is a very important issue. So the plan that Senator Sanders and I and others support, Medicare-for-all, is how you get to single payer. But it has a buy-in transition period, which is really important.",Candidate,female,1,2,148
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"In 2005, when I ran for Congress in a 2-to-1 Republican district, I actually ran on Medicare-for-all, and I won that 2-to-1 Republican district twice. And the way I formulated it was simple. Anyone who doesn't have access to insurance they like, they could buy it at a percentage of income they could afford.",Candidate,female,1,2,149
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So that's what we put in to the transition period for our Medicare-for-all plan. I believe we need to get to universal health care as a right and not a privilege to single payer. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers, if they want to compete, they can certainly try, but they've never put people over their profits, and I doubt they ever will.",Candidate,female,1,2,150
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So what will happen is people will choose Medicare, you will transition, we will get to Medicare-for-all, and then your step to single-payer is so short, I would make it an earned benefit, just like Social Security, so that you buy in your whole life, it is always there for you, and it's permanent and it's universal.",Candidate,female,1,2,151
Lester Holt,NA,"Senator, your time is up. I want to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.",Moderator,male,1,2,152
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Yeah, we've talked - look, everybody who says Medicare-for-all, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you're actually supposed to get from here to there.",Candidate,male,1,2,153
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,154
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Now, here's how I would do it. It's very similar. I would call it Medicare-for-all who want it. You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.",Candidate,male,1,2,155
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But let's remember, even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there, there's still a private sector. That's fine. It's just that for our primary care, we can't be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system.",Candidate,male,1,2,156
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"This one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with the terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living, and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced.",Candidate,male,1,2,157
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was going to bankrupt our family, because of Medicare. And I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not live in financial fear.",Candidate,male,1,2,158
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,159
Lester Holt,NA,"Your time is complete. Vice President Biden, I want to put the question to you. You were an architect - one of the architects of Obamacare. So where do we go from here?",Moderator,male,1,2,160
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, look, this is very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two boys were very, very badly injured. I couldn't imagine what it would be like if I'd not had adequate health care available to me.",Candidate,male,1,2,161
Joe Biden,NA,"And then, when my son came home from Iraq after a year, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and he was given months to live. I can't fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said, by the way, the last six months of your life, you're on your own. We're cutting off. You've used up your time.",Candidate,male,1,2,162
Joe Biden,NA,"The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare, to build on what we did.",Candidate,male,1,2,163
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,164
Joe Biden,NA,"And, secondly - secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option. Everyone, whether they have private insurance or employer insurance and no insurance, they, in fact, can buy in, in the exchange to a Medicare-like plan. And the way to do that - we can do it quickly.",Candidate,male,1,2,165

Lester Holt,NA,"Let me turn to Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, you have basically - you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government-run plan. None of the states that have tried something like that, California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful. If politicians can't make it in those states, how would you implement it on a national level? How does this work?",Moderator,male,1,2,170
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Lester, I find it hard to believe that every other major country on Earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north of me, Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide health care to every man, woman, and child, and in most cases, they're spending 50 percent per capita what we are spending.",Candidate,male,1,2,171
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,172
Bernie Sanders,NA,Let's be clear. Let us be very clear. The function of health care today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way. The function of the health care system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies.,Candidate,male,1,2,173
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And last year, if you can believe it, while we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs - and I will lower prescription drugs prices in half in this country - top 10 companies made $69 billion in profit.

Marianne Williamson,NA,"Well, first of all, the government should never have made the deal with big pharma that they couldn't negotiate. That was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us.",Candidate,female,1,2,188
Marianne Williamson,NA,"You know, I want to say that while I agree with - and I'm with Senator Bennet and others, but I agree with almost everything here - I'll tell you one thing, it's really nice if we've got all these plans, but if you think we're going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you've got another thing coming, because he didn't win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying make America great again.",Candidate,female,1,2,189
Marianne Williamson,NA,"We've got to get deeper than just these superficial fixes, as important as they are. Even if we're just talking about the superficial fixes, ladies and gentlemen, we don't have a health care system in the United States. We have a sickness care system in the United States. We just wait until somebody gets sick, and then we talk about who's going pay for the treatment and how they're going to be treated.",Candidate,female,1,2,190
Marianne Williamson,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,2,191
Marianne Williamson,NA,"What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses, so many more compared to other countries.

Michael Bennet,NA,I believe it will get us there quickly. There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can't. They're too wealthy. Wealthy? They make too much money to be on Medicaid. They can't afford health insurance.,Candidate,male,1,2,200
Michael Bennet,NA,"When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single payer, there are 35 million people in Canada. There are 330 million people in the United States, easily the number of people on a public option that - it could easily be 35 million.

Kamala Harris,NA,"There is, any night in America, a parent who has seen that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 911, what should I do? And they say, take the child to the Emergency Room. And so they get in their car and they drive and they are sitting in the parking lot outside of the Emergency Room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the forehead of their child, knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors, even though they have insurance, they will be out a 5,000 deductible, $5,000 deductible when they walk through those doors.",Candidate,female,1,2,217

Savannah Guthrie,NA,"okay. Let me start with you, Mayor Buttigieg, why? Mayor Buttigieg, why?",Moderator,female,1,2,231
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And, remember, we are talking about something people are given a chance to buy into, in the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes, directly or indirectly.",Candidate,male,1,2,232
Pete Buttigieg,NA,This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.,Candidate,male,1,2,233
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But, of course, the real problem is we shouldn't have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship. It makes no sense. And the American people . ..",Candidate,male,1,2,234
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,235
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The American people agree on what to do. This is a crazy thing.

The American people want a pathway to citizenship, they want protections for ""dreamers"". We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country.",Candidate,male,1,2,236
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And as part of a compromise, we can do whatever common-sense measures are needed at the border, but Washington can't deliver on something the American people want.

Savannah Guthrie,NA,Can you explain that change?,Moderator,female,1,2,246

Joe Biden,NA,"But here's the deal, the deal is that he's right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country but they also, for example, they've increased the life span of Social Security because they have a job, they're paying a Social Security tax. That's what they're doing. It has increased the life span.",Candidate,male,1,2,248
Joe Biden,NA,They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they are in extremis.,Candidate,male,1,2,249
Joe Biden,NA,"The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies. We can deal with the insurance companies by, number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading advertising, what they're doing on opioids, what they're doing paying doctors to prescribe.",Candidate,male,1,2,250
Joe Biden,NA,We could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are. We can do this by making sure that we're in a position that we in fact allow people. Time's up?,Candidate,male,1,2,251

Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"One - day one, hour one?",Moderator,male,1,2,289
John Hickenlooper,NA,"Well, certainly the images we have seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by.

John Hickenlooper,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,291
John Hickenlooper,NA,"I would have told you it was unbelievable. And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is. We make sure that there are the sufficient facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families, that children are with their families.",Candidate,male,1,2,292
John Hickenlooper,NA,"We have to make sure that ICE is completely reformed and they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way, where they're addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border, and we have to make sure ultimately that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing, and access to medical care.",Candidate,male,1,2,293
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,Ms. Williamson?,Moderator,male,1,2,294
Marianne Williamson,NA,"Yes. What Donald Trump has done to these children - and it's not just in Colorado - Governor, you're right, it is kidnapping, and it's extremely important for us to realize that. If you forcibly take a child from their parents' arms, you are kidnapping them.",Candidate,female,1,2,295
Marianne Williamson,NA,"And if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center, that's inflicting chronic trauma upon them. That's called child abuse. This is collective child abuse.",Candidate,female,1,2,296
Marianne Williamson,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,2,297

Marianne Williamson,NA,"This is extremely important. And it's also important for all of us. Remember, and I have great respect for everyone who is on this stage. But we're going to talk about what to do about health care? Well, where have you been, guys? Because it's not just a matter of a plan.

Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Senator Gillibrand, what would you do as president, with a reality?",Moderator,male,1,2,305
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he's done to this country is he's torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. When he started separating children at the border from their parents, the fact that seven children have died in his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them.",Candidate,female,1,2,306
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So I would do a few things. First, I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border. I would have a community-based treatment center, where we're doing it within the communities, where asylum seekers are given lawyers, where there's real immigration judges, not employees of the attorney general, but appointed for life, and have a community-based system. I would fund border security.",Candidate,female,1,2,307
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"But the worst thing President Trump has done is he's diverted the funds away from cross-border terrorism, cross-border human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking, and he's given that money to the for-profit prisons. I would not be spending money in for-profit prisons to lock up children and asylum seekers.",Candidate,female,1,2,308
Kirsten Gillibrand,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,2,309
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border. If you'd be so kind, raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation? Can we keep the hands up so we could see them?",Moderator,male,1,2,310
Jose Diaz-Balart,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,1,2,311
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Let's remember, that's not just a theoretical exercise. That criminalization, that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that, it's no longer possible. Of course it wouldn't be possible anyway in my presidency, because it is dead wrong.",Candidate,male,1,2,312
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We've got to talk about one other thing, because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now, our party doesn't talk about that as much, largely for a very good reason, which was, we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion.",Candidate,male,1,2,313
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it. And for a party that associates itself with Christianity, to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.",Candidate,male,1,2,314
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,315

Joe Biden,NA,The first thing - the first thing I would do is unite families. I'd surge immediately billions of dollars' worth of help to the region immediately.,Candidate,male,1,2,317
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, I talk about foreign policy. I'm the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term, to spend $740 million to deal with the problem, and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working.",Candidate,male,1,2,318
Joe Biden,NA,"We saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was abated. And along came this president, and he said - he immediately discontinued that.",Candidate,male,1,2,319
Joe Biden,NA,We all talk about these things. I did it. I did it.,Candidate,male,1,2,320
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,321
Joe Biden,NA,"Seven hundred and forty - now look, second thing. Second thing we have to do. The law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite those families, period. And if not, we'd put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents.",Candidate,male,1,2,322
Joe Biden,NA,"And lastly, the idea that he's in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush, that is outrageous.",Candidate,male,1,2,323

Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,329
Joe Biden,NA,"But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.",Candidate,male,1,2,330
Jose Diaz-Balart,NA,"Fifteen seconds, if you could, if you wish to answer. Should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?",Moderator,male,1,2,331

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Number two, number two, picking up on the point that Joe made, we've got to look at the root causes.

Eric Swalwell,NA,"Day one for me, families are reunited. This president, though, for immigrants, there's nothing he will not do to separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census.

Kamala Harris,NA,"And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals.

Lester Holt,NA,"We're going to turn - we're going to turn to the issue of trade now, if we can. Last night, we asked the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. Four of them mentioned China. U.S. businesses say China steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low.",Moderator,male,1,2,358
Lester Holt,NA,"I want to ask this to Senator Bennet, to start off with. How would you stand up to China?",Moderator,male,1,2,359
Michael Bennet,NA,"Well, I think that, first of all, the biggest - the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China. And, second, on China, we've got - because of what they've done with our election.",Candidate,male,1,2,360
Michael Bennet,NA,"In China, I think the president has been right to push back on China, but has done it in completely the wrong way. We should mobilize the entire rest of the world, who all have a shared interest in pushing back on China's mercantilist trade policies, and I think we can do that.",Candidate,male,1,2,361
Michael Bennet,NA,"I'd like to answer the other question before this, as well.",Candidate,male,1,2,362
Lester Holt,NA,You have the time . ..,Moderator,male,1,2,363
Michael Bennet,NA,"When I - when I - when I see these kids at the border, I see my mom, because I know she sees herself, because she was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust in Poland. And for Donald Trump to be doing what he's doing to children and their families at the border - I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country - that had the most progressive Dream Act that's ever been conceived, much less passed, and got 68 votes in the Senate - that had $46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated, 21st century border security, not a medieval wall . ..",Candidate,male,1,2,364

Michael Bennet,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,369
Lester Holt,NA,"Mr. Yang, let me bring you in on this, on the issue of China. You have expressed a lot of concerns about technology and taking jobs. Are you worried about China? And if so, how would you stand up against it?",Moderator,male,1,2,370
Andrew Yang,NA,"Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our greatest geopolitical threat, because they have been hacking our democracy successfully and they've been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years. So we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.",Candidate,male,1,2,371
Andrew Yang,NA,"Now, China, they do pirate our intellectual property. It's a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides.",Candidate,male,1,2,372
Andrew Yang,NA,"I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that's now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or people in China. It's been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void. So we need to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship, but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.",Candidate,male,1,2,373
Lester Holt,NA,"All right, Mayor Buttigieg . ..",Moderator,male,1,2,374
Lester Holt,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,1,2,375
Lester Holt,NA,How would you - how would you stand up against China?,Moderator,male,1,2,376
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I mean, first of all, we've got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing, they're using technology for the perfection of dictatorship.",Candidate,male,1,2,377
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But their fundamental economic model isn't going to change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren't in the shadow of a factory are somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting.",Candidate,male,1,2,378
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Tariffs are taxes. And Americans are going to pay on average $800 more a year because of these tariffs. Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence. And this president is fixated on the China relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. We've got a much bigger issue on our hands.",Candidate,male,1,2,379
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But at a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions, the biggest thing we've got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness.

Chuck Todd,NA,"Thank you, Lester, Savannah and Jose.",Moderator,male,1,2,398
Chuck Todd,NA,"Let's quickly recap the rules one more time. Twenty candidates qualified for this first debate. We've heard from 10 of them from last night. We're hearing from 10 more tonight. The breakdown for each night was selected at random. The candidates will have 60 seconds to answer direct questions, 30 seconds for follow-ups, if necessary.",Moderator,male,1,2,399
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Because of this large field of candidates, not every person will be able comment on everything, but the less audience reaction there is, the more time they will all get.",Moderator,female,1,2,400
Rachel Maddow,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,2,401
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Over the course of the next hour, we will hear from all of these candidates, but we are going to begin this hour with Mayor Buttigieg.",Moderator,female,1,2,402
Rachel Maddow,NA,"In the last five years, civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system. Your community of South Bend, Indiana, has recently been in uproar over an officer-involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black.",Moderator,female,1,2,403
Rachel Maddow,NA,Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?,Moderator,female,1,2,404
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Because I couldn't get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting, a black man, Eric Logan, killed by a white officer. And I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer said he was attacked with a knife, but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess. And we're hurting.",Candidate,male,1,2,405
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back.",Candidate,male,1,2,406
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism, whatever this particular incident teaches us, we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time, not just from what's happened in the past, but from what's happening around the country in the present. It threatens the well-being of every community.",Candidate,male,1,2,407
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle, when they see a police officer approaching, feels the exact same thing . ..",Candidate,male,1,2,408
Rachel Maddow,NA,Mr. Mayor . ..,Moderator,female,1,2,409

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Governor, I'll give you 30 seconds.",Moderator,female,1,2,415
John Hickenlooper,NA,I think that the question they're asking in South Bend and I think across the country is why has it taken so long?,Candidate,male,1,2,416
John Hickenlooper,NA,"We had a shooting when I first became mayor, 10 years before Ferguson. And the community came together and we created an Office of the Independent Monitor, a Civilian Oversight Commission, and we diversified the police force in two years. We actually did de-escalation training.",Candidate,male,1,2,417
John Hickenlooper,NA,"I think the real question that America should be asking is why, five years after Ferguson, every city doesn't have this level of police accountability.",Candidate,male,1,2,418
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.",Moderator,female,1,2,419
Rachel Maddow,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,2,420
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I've got to respond to that. Look, we have taken so many steps toward police accountability that, you know, the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. We're obviously not there yet, and I accept responsibility for that because I'm in charge.",Candidate,male,1,2,421
Eric Swalwell,NA,"If the camera wasn't on and that was the policy, you should fire the chief.",Candidate,male,1,2,422
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So under Indiana law, this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved.",Candidate,male,1,2,423
Eric Swalwell,NA,But you're the mayor. You should fire the chief - if that's the policy and someone died.,Candidate,male,1,2,424
Marianne Williamson,NA,"All of these issues are extremely important, but they are specifics; they are symptoms. And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice, both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system. And the Democratic Party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. I do not believe . ..",Candidate,female,1,2,425

Rachel Maddow,NA,"If I could preface this, we will give you 30 seconds, because we're going to come back to you on this again in just a moment. But go for 30 seconds.",Moderator,female,1,2,437
Kamala Harris,NA,"okay. So on the issue of race, I couldn't agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly. I - there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a co-worker, who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.",Candidate,female,1,2,438
Kamala Harris,NA,"Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she - because we were black. And I will say also that - that, in this campaign, we have also heard - and I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.",Candidate,female,1,2,439
Kamala Harris,NA,"But I also believe, and it's personal - and I was actually very - it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.",Candidate,female,1,2,440
Kamala Harris,NA,"And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.",Candidate,female,1,2,441
Kamala Harris,NA,"So I will tell you that, on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.",Candidate,female,1,2,442

Rachel Maddow,NA,Vice President Biden?,Moderator,female,1,2,446
Rachel Maddow,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,2,447
Joe Biden,NA,"It's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true, number one. Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I'm happy to do that.",Candidate,male,1,2,448
Joe Biden,NA,"I was a public defender. I didn't become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender, when, in fact - when, in fact . ..",Candidate,male,1,2,449

Joe Biden,NA,". . . when, in fact, my city was in flames because of the assassination of Dr. King, number one.",Candidate,male,1,2,451
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, as the U.S. - excuse me, as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who, in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way.",Candidate,male,1,2,452
Joe Biden,NA,"The fact is that, in terms of bussing, the bussing, I never - you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. That's fine. That's one of the things I argued for, that we should not be - we should be breaking down these lines.",Candidate,male,1,2,453
Joe Biden,NA,"But so the bottom line here is, look, everything I have done in my career, I ran because of civil rights, I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights, and those civil rights, by the way, include not just only African Americans, but the LGBT community.",Candidate,male,1,2,454
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,455
Kamala Harris,NA,"But, Vice President Biden, do you agree today - do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose bussing in America then? Do you agree?",Candidate,female,1,2,456
Joe Biden,NA,I did not oppose bussing in America. What I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education. That's what I opposed. I did not oppose . ..,Candidate,male,1,2,457
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America. I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.",Candidate,female,1,2,458
Joe Biden,NA,Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision.,Candidate,male,1,2,459
Kamala Harris,NA,So that's where the federal government must step in.,Candidate,female,1,2,460
Joe Biden,NA,The federal government . ..,Candidate,male,1,2,461
Kamala Harris,NA,That's why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.,Candidate,female,1,2,462
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,2,463
Kamala Harris,NA,"That's why we need to pass the Equality Act. That's why we need to pass the ERA, because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.",Candidate,female,1,2,464
Joe Biden,NA,I've supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for . ..,Candidate,male,1,2,465
Chuck Todd,NA,"Vice President Biden, 30 seconds, because I want to bring other people into this.",Moderator,male,1,2,466
Joe Biden,NA,"I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I'm the guy that extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I've also argued very strongly that we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody, once they, in fact - anyway, my time is up. I'm sorry.",Candidate,male,1,2,467
Chuck Todd,NA,"Thank you, Vice President.",Moderator,male,1,2,468
Kamala Harris,NA,All of these things have to do . ..,Candidate,female,1,2,469
Chuck Todd,NA,"Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, I'm going to go to you on this. You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate's race or age or sexual orientation.",Moderator,male,1,2,470
Chuck Todd,NA,Many Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night's stage and the perspective that diversity brings to this contest and to these issues.,Moderator,male,1,2,471
Bernie Sanders,NA,Absolutely.,Candidate,male,1,2,472
Chuck Todd,NA,Are you telling Democratic voters that diversity shouldn't matter when they make this decision?,Moderator,male,1,2,473
Bernie Sanders,NA,"No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican Party, we encourage diversity, we believe in diversity. That's what America is about.",Candidate,male,1,2,474
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But in addition to diversity, in terms of having more women, more people from the LGBT community, we also have to do something else. And that is, we have to ask ourselves a simple question, in that how come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago, and that in the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth?",Candidate,male,1,2,475
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We need a party that is diverse, but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.",Candidate,male,1,2,476
Chuck Todd,NA,"Senator Gillibrand, I want to give you 30 seconds on this.",Moderator,male,1,2,477
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"Well, first of all, where Bernie left off, we've heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans, but the truth is, until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in politics, the fact that Washington is run by the special interests, you are never going to solve any of these problems.",Candidate,female,1,2,478
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"I have the most comprehensive approach, that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption, to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics, we can guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, we can deal with institutional racism, we can take on income inequality, and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.",Candidate,female,1,2,479
Kirsten Gillibrand,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,2,480
Joe Biden,NA,And the first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was young senator.,Candidate,male,1,2,481
Chuck Todd,NA,"Thank you, Vice President. We want to shift topics here. Senator Bennet, the next question is for you.",Moderator,male,1,2,482
Chuck Todd,NA,"On the issue of partisan gridlock, President Obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection, Republicans would want to work with Democrats, fever would break. That did not happen. Now Vice President Biden is saying the same thing, that if he is elected in 2020, both parties will want to work together.",Moderator,male,1,2,483
Chuck Todd,NA,Should voters believe that somehow if there is a Democratic president in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear?,Moderator,male,1,2,484
Michael Bennet,NA,"Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.",Candidate,male,1,2,485
Michael Bennet,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,486
Michael Bennet,NA,"Second, second, second, that's why it is so important for us to win not just the presidency, to have somebody that can run in all 50 states, but to win the Senate, as well. And that's why we have to propose policies that can be supported, like Medicare act, so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington, D.C. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying. I share a lot of her views.",Candidate,male,1,2,487
Michael Bennet,NA,We need to end gerrymandering in Washington. We need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.,Candidate,male,1,2,488
Michael Bennet,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,489
Michael Bennet,NA,The court today said they couldn't do anything about it. We need to overturn Citizens United. The court was the one that gave us Citizens United. And the attack on voting rights in Shelby v. Holder is something we need to deal with.,Candidate,male,1,2,490
Michael Bennet,NA,"All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate. And we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition. It's the only way we can do it. We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand people's right to get to the polls, and I think then we can succeed.",Candidate,male,1,2,491
Chuck Todd,NA,"Time's up. Vice President Biden, 30 seconds. What - it does sound as if you haven't seen what's been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years. It didn't happen. Why?",Moderator,male,1,2,492
Joe Biden,NA,"I have seen what happened. Just since we were vice president, we needed three votes to pass an $800 billion Recovery Act that kept us from going into depression. I got three votes changed.",Candidate,male,1,2,493
Joe Biden,NA,"We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate. And as recently as after president got elected, I was able to put together a coalition of the Cures Act to have billions of dollars go into cancer research, bipartisan.",Candidate,male,1,2,494
Joe Biden,NA,"But sometimes you can't do that. Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them. I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates, and guess what? We beat them, and we won back the Senate.",Candidate,male,1,2,495
Chuck Todd,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,1,2,496
Michael Bennet,NA,"Chuck, the problem with what the vice president . ..",Candidate,male,1,2,497

Chuck Todd,NA,"Yeah, 30 seconds. Go ahead.",Moderator,male,1,2,501
Michael Bennet,NA,"Sometimes you do have to beat them, but - but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the tea party. It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently. The Democratic Party had been running against that for 10 years.",Candidate,male,1,2,502
Michael Bennet,NA,"We lost that economic argument, because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester. That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell.",Candidate,male,1,2,503
Joe Biden,NA,"Oh, come on.",Candidate,male,1,2,504
Michael Bennet,NA,It was a terrible deal for America.,Candidate,male,1,2,505

Chuck Todd,NA,"Go ahead, 30 seconds.",Moderator,male,1,2,509
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"You heard from the Republicans that the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors. You heard it. They actually said those words. So the corruption in Washington is real, and it is something that makes every one of the plans we've heard about over the last several months impossible.",Candidate,female,1,2,510
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"And I have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections, publicly funded elections, so we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters, not into the Koch brothers.",Candidate,female,1,2,511
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,We were talking about issues. Imagine - we're in Florida - imagine the Parkland kids having as much power in our democracy as the Koch brothers or the NRA.,Candidate,female,1,2,512

Chuck Todd,NA,Thank you very much.,Moderator,male,1,2,520
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Sanders, I'd like to put a different question to you. Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land since 1973. Now that there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, several Republican-controlled states have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion. One of those laws could very well make it to the Supreme Court during your presidency, if you're elected president. What is your plan if Roe is struck down in the court while you're president?",Moderator,female,1,2,521

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Second of all, let me make a - let me make a promise here. You ask about litmus tests. My litmus test is I will never appoint any, nominate any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend Roe v. Wade.",Candidate,male,1,2,524

Bernie Sanders,NA,"I do not believe in packing the court. We got a terrible 5-4 majority conservative court right now. But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. And that brings in new blood into the Supreme Court and a majority, I hope, that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and the corporations cannot run the United States of America.",Candidate,male,1,2,527

Bernie Sanders,NA,I'm sorry?,Candidate,male,1,2,530
Rachel Maddow,NA,". . . what if the court has already overturned Roe and Roe is gone? All of the things you've just described would be to try to preserve Roe. If Roe is gone, what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?",Moderator,female,1,2,531
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We will pass - well, first of all, let me tell you this. It didn't come up here, but let's face this, Medicare-for-all guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.",Candidate,male,1,2,532
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,1,2,533
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"And can I address this for a second? And I want to talk directly, directly to America's women and to the men who love them. Women's reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican Party. Thirty states are trying to overturn Roe v. Wade right now.",Candidate,female,1,2,534
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,And it is mind-boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among Democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense.,Candidate,female,1,2,535
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"But let me tell you one thing about politics, because it goes to the corruption and the dealmaking. When the door is closed and negotiations are made, there are conversations about women's rights and compromises have been made on our backs. That's how we got to Hyde, that's how the Hyde Amendment was created, a compromise by leaders of both parties.",Candidate,female,1,2,536
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"Then we have the ACA. During the ACA negotiation, I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn't sold down the river, or abortion services. And so what we need to know is imagine this one question. When we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office, God forbid, to do negotiations, who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk, to fight for women's rights?",Candidate,female,1,2,537
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"I have been the fiercest advocate for women's reproductive freedom for over a decade. And I promise you as president when that door closes, I will guarantee women's reproductive freedom no matter what.",Candidate,female,1,2,538

Chuck Todd,NA,Last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their proposals. Explain specifically what yours is.,Moderator,male,1,2,543
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, first of all, I don't even call it climate change. It's a climate crisis. It represents an existential threat to us as a species. And the fact that we have a president of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril.",Candidate,female,1,2,544
Kamala Harris,NA,"I visited, while the embers were smoldering, the wildfires in California. I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning. And on this issue it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now.",Candidate,female,1,2,545
Kamala Harris,NA,"That is why I support a Green New Deal. It is why I believe on day one and as president will reenter us in the Paris agreement, because we have to take these issues seriously. And, frankly, we have a president of the United States, we talked about, you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?",Candidate,female,1,2,546
Kamala Harris,NA,It's Donald Trump.,Candidate,female,1,2,547
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,1,2,548
Kamala Harris,NA,"And I'm going to tell you why. And I'm going to tell you why. Because I agree, climate change represents an existential threat. He denies the science. You want to talk about North Korea, a real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal, but what does he do? He embraces Kim Jong Un, a dictator, for the sake of a photo op.",Candidate,female,1,2,549
Kamala Harris,NA,"Putin. You want to talk about Russia? He takes the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community when it comes to a threat to our democracy and our elections. These are the issues that are before us, Chuck.",Candidate,female,1,2,550

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, the reality is we need to begin adapting right away, but we also can't skip a beat on preventing climate change from getting even worse. It's why we need aggressive and ambitious measures. It's why we need to do a carbon tax and dividend.",Candidate,male,1,2,554
Pete Buttigieg,NA,But I would propose we do it in a way that is rebated out to the American people in a progressive fashion so that most Americans are made more than whole.,Candidate,male,1,2,555
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"This isn't theoretical for us in South Bend, either. Parts of California are on fire. Right here in Florida, they're talking about sea level rise. Well, in Indiana I had to activate the emergency operations center of our city twice in less than two years. The first time was a 1,000-year flood and the next time was a 500-year flood.",Candidate,male,1,2,556
Pete Buttigieg,NA,This is not just happening on the Arctic ice caps; this is happening in the middle of the country. And we've got to be dramatically more aggressive moving forward.,Candidate,male,1,2,557
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Now, here's what very few people talk about. First of all, rural America can be part of the solution instead of being told they're part of the problem. With the right kind of soil management and other kind of investments, rural America could be a huge part of how we get this done.",Candidate,male,1,2,558

Lots of your colleagues onstage tonight have talked about moving away from fossil fuels entirely. Can oil and gas companies be real partners in this fight?",Moderator,female,1,2,566
John Hickenlooper,NA,"Well, I share the sense of urgency. I'm - I'm a scientist, so I - I recognize that, within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage, but, you know, guaranteeing everybody a government job is not going to get us there. Socialism, in that sense, is not the solution. We have to look at what really will make a difference.",Candidate,male,1,2,567
John Hickenlooper,NA,"In Colorado, we're closing a couple of coal plants, replacing it with wind, solar and batteries and the monthly bills go down. We've gone on - we're building a network for electric vehicles. We are working with the oil and gas industry and we've created the first methane regulations in the country.",Candidate,male,1,2,568
John Hickenlooper,NA,"Methane is 25 times worse than C02. And then we've got to get to that last part. I mean, the industrial - heavy industry, we haven't seen the plans yet. If you look at the real problem, C02, the worst polluters in CO2 is China, is the United States, and then it's concrete and its exhalation.",Candidate,male,1,2,569
John Hickenlooper,NA,"And beyond that, I think we've got to recognize that only by bringing people together, businesses, nonprofits - and we can't demonize every business.

Rachel Maddow,NA,So are there significant ways you can cut carbon emissions if you have to do it with no support from Congress?,Moderator,female,1,2,577
Joe Biden,NA,"The answer is yes. Number one, in our administration, we built the largest wind farm in the world, the largest solar energy facility in the world. We drove down the price, competitive price of both of those renewable energy - renewable sources.",Candidate,male,1,2,578
Joe Biden,NA,"I would immediately insist that we in fact build 500,000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America, working with governors, mayors and others, so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2020 - by the year 2030.",Candidate,male,1,2,579
Joe Biden,NA,"I would make sure that we invested $400 million in new science and technology, to be the exporter not only of the green economy, but economy that can create millions of jobs. But I would immediately join the Paris Climate Accord. I would up the ante in that accord, which it calls for, because we make up 15 percent of the problem; 85 percent of the world makes up the rest.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Look, the old ways are no longer relevant. The scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet. This is a global issue. What the president of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change but tell the rest of the world that, instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of destruction, let us get together for the common enemy, and that is to transform the world's energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,701
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, we increased that background check when - during the Obama-Biden administration. I'm also the only guy that got assault weapons banned, banned, and the number of clips in a gun banned.",Candidate,male,1,2,702
Joe Biden,NA,"And so, folks, look, and I would buy back those weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that's a good expenditure of money.",Candidate,male,1,2,703
Joe Biden,NA,"And, lastly, we should have smart guns. No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It's within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers.",Candidate,male,1,2,704
Rachel Maddow,NA,Mr. Vice President . ..,Moderator,female,1,2,705

Chuck Todd,NA,All right. Lester Holt has our next question.,Moderator,male,1,2,707
Chuck Todd,NA,"Lester, take it away.",Moderator,male,1,2,708
Lester Holt,NA,"All right, Chuck. This is a question from our viewers. We put some - the suggestions that - asked maybe they could share some. Here's one that came from Kathleen (ph) from Canby, Oregon, who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and the process on our reputation abroad. The question is, what do you see as important early steps in reversing the damage done? And we'll put this one to Senator Bennet.",Moderator,male,1,2,709
Michael Bennet,NA,"Thank you very much. What an excellent question. First of all, we have to restore our democracy at home. The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership. We have a president who doesn't believe in the rule of law, he doesn't believe in freedom of the press, he doesn't believe in an independent judiciary. He believes in the corruption that he's brought to Washington, D.C. And that is what we have to change, and that's why everybody is up here tonight, and I appreciate the fact that they're up here for that reason.",Candidate,male,1,2,710
Michael Bennet,NA,"Second, we've got to - we've got to restore the relationships that he's destroyed with our allies, not just in Europe. He flew to the G-20 last night and attacked Japan, Germany, and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia.",Candidate,male,1,2,711
Michael Bennet,NA,"And when you've got a situation where you have a president who says something happened in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn't know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America. And we need to change that.",Candidate,male,1,2,712
Michael Bennet,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,713
Chuck Todd,NA,"This is a perfect time - thank you, Senator. This is a perfect time for me to do another one of these down the line. And this is what this question is, which is, you're going to have to - you're likely going to have to reset a relationship between America and another country or entity if you become president because of some - perhaps because of some relationship that you just mentioned about President Trump. What is the first relationship you would like to reset as president? I'm going to go down the line, and I'll start with Ms. Williamson.",Moderator,male,1,2,714
Marianne Williamson,NA,"Well, one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say we're back . ..",Candidate,female,1,2,715

Chuck Todd,NA,Thanks for the quickness. Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,male,1,2,728
Pete Buttigieg,NA,We have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off worse between now and then. What we know is that our relationship with the entire world needs to change.,Candidate,male,1,2,729
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,730

Rachel Maddow,NA,Thank you all. Thank you all. We have one . ..,Moderator,female,1,2,749
Michael Bennet,NA,That's a good plan.,Candidate,male,1,2,750
Rachel Maddow,NA,". . . last question for Vice President Biden tonight. You made your decades of experience in foreign policy a pillar of your campaign, but when the time came to say yes or no on one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the last century, you voted for the Iraq War. You have since said you regret that vote. But why should voters trust your judgment when it comes to making a decision about taking the country to war the next time?",Moderator,female,1,2,751
Joe Biden,NA,"Because once we - once Bush abused that power, what happened was, we got elected after that. I made sure - the president turned to me and said, Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq. I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq, and my son was one of them.",Candidate,male,1,2,752
Joe Biden,NA,I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. It's long overdue. It should end.,Candidate,male,1,2,753
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,754
Joe Biden,NA,"And, thirdly, I believe that you're not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism.",Candidate,male,1,2,755
Joe Biden,NA,"So I would eliminate the act that allowed us to go into war, and not - the AUMF, and make sure that it could only be used for what its intent was, and that is to go after terrorists, but never do it alone. That's why we have to repair our alliances. We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places. That's what I would do. That's what I have done. And I know how to do it.",Candidate,male,1,2,756
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Sanders, 30 seconds.",Moderator,female,1,2,757
Rachel Maddow,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,1,2,758
Bernie Sanders,NA,"One of the differences - one of the differences that Joe and I have in our record is Joe voted for that war, I helped lead the opposition to that war, which was a total disaster.",Candidate,male,1,2,759
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,760
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Second of all, I helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the War Powers Act to get the United States out of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on Earth.",Candidate,male,1,2,761
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,1,2,762
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And thirdly, let me be very clear. I will do everything I can to prevent a war with Iran, which would be far worse than disastrous war with Iraq.",Candidate,male,1,2,763

Eric Swalwell,NA,"We can't be a forward-looking party if we look to the past for our leadership. I'm a congressman, but also a father of a 2-year-old and an infant. When I'm not changing diapers, I'm changing Washington. Most of the time, the diapers smell better.",Candidate,male,1,2,774
Eric Swalwell,NA,"I went to Congress at 31, and I found a Washington that doesn't work for people like you and me. It's made of the rich and the disconnected. I was the first in my family to go to college and have student loan debt.",Candidate,male,1,2,775
Eric Swalwell,NA,"And so I have led the effort to elect the next generation of members of Congress, and we have a moment to seize. This is a can-do generation. This is the generation that will end climate chaos. This is the generation that will solve student loan debt. And this is the generation that will say enough is enough and end gun violence. This generation demands bold solutions. That's why I'm running for president.",Candidate,male,1,2,776
Lester Holt,NA,"Congressman, thank you.",Moderator,male,1,2,777
Savannah Guthrie,NA,"Ms. Williamson, 45 seconds for your closing.",Moderator,female,1,2,778
Marianne Williamson,NA,I'm sorry we haven't talked more tonight about how we're going to beat Donald Trump. I have an idea about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk. He's not going to be beaten just somebody who has plans.,Candidate,female,1,2,779
Marianne Williamson,NA,"He's going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea what this man has done. This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he has harnessed fear for political purposes. So, Mr. President, if you're listening, I want you to hear me, please. You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out.",Candidate,female,1,2,780
Marianne Williamson,NA,"So I, sir, I have a feeling you know what you're doing. I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field. And, sir, love will win.",Candidate,female,1,2,781

Michael Bennet,NA,"The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States, especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools. That's why I'm running for president.",Candidate,male,1,2,786
Michael Bennet,NA,"I've had two tough races in Colorado, but by bringing people together, not by making empty promises. And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump, end the corruption in Washington, and build a new era of American democracy and American opportunity.",Candidate,male,1,2,787

Chuck Todd,NA,Governor Hickenlooper?,Moderator,male,1,2,791
John Hickenlooper,NA,"I'm a small-business owner who brought that same scrappy spirit to big Colorado, one of the most progressive states in America. We expanded reproductive health to reduce teenage abortion by 64 percent. We were the first state to legalize marijuana, and we transformed our justice system in the process.",Candidate,male,1,2,792
John Hickenlooper,NA,"We passed universal background checks in a purple state. We got to near universal health care coverage. We attacked climate change with the toughest methane regulations in the country. And for the last three years, we've been the number-one economy in America.",Candidate,male,1,2,793
John Hickenlooper,NA,"You don't need big government to do big things. I know that because I'm the one person up here who's actually done the big progressive things everyone else is talking about.

But our rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v. Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them.",Candidate,female,1,2,798
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will. I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed ""don't ask/don't tell."" I've stood up to the banks and voted against the bailout twice. I've stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate. And I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly funded elections to deal with political corruption.",Candidate,female,1,2,799
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"Now is not the time to play it safe. Now is not the time to be afraid of firsts. We need a president who will take on the big challenges, even if she stands alone. Join me in fighting for this.",Candidate,female,1,2,800

Andrew Yang,NA,"Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee, and that is, who can beat Donald Trump in 2020? That is the right question. And the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected, and we'll have a vision of a trickle-up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as Democrats and progressives.",Candidate,male,1,2,805
Andrew Yang,NA,I am that candidate. I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump. It is not left; it is not right. It is forward. And that is where I'll take the country in 2020.,Candidate,male,1,2,806

Kamala Harris,NA,"Second, this election is about you. This is about your hopes and your dreams and your fears and what wakes you up at 3 o'clock in the morning. And that's why I have what I call a 3 a.m. agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver health care to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month.",Candidate,female,1,2,811
Kamala Harris,NA,"And when I think about what our country needs, I promise you, I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity, with honesty, speaking the truth, and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper.

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I've experienced being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court. And I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below $20,000 when I took office into a brighter future.",Candidate,male,1,2,817
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I'm running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"I suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying, these are good people, they have great ideas. But how come nothing really changes? How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class? How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty? How come 45 million people still have student debt? How come three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?",Candidate,male,1,2,823
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And here is the answer, nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military-industrial complex, and the fossil fuel industry.

Joe Biden,NA,Thank you very much.,Candidate,male,1,2,828
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm ready to lead this country because I think it's important we restore the soul of this nation. This president has ripped it out. It's the only president in our history who has equated racists and white supremacists with ordinary and decent people. He's the only president who has, in fact, engaged and embraced dictators and thumbed their nose at our allies.",Candidate,male,1,2,829
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm, secondly, running for president because I think we have to restore the backbone of America, the poor and hard-working middle class people. You can't do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had.",Candidate,male,1,2,830
Joe Biden,NA,"Last thing, we've got to unite the United States of America, as much as anybody says we can't. If we do, there's not a single thing the American people can't do.

Steve Bullock,NA,"I come from a state where a lot of people voted for Donald Trump. Let's not kid ourselves. He will be hard to beat.

Steve Bullock,NA,"Look, I'm a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state. Not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done.

Marianne Williamson,NA,"In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility. It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving. We have not ever totally actualized this ideal. But at the times when we have done best, we have tried. And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces.",Candidate,female,2,1,12
Marianne Williamson,NA,"We did that with abolition and with women's suffrage and with civil rights. And now it is time for a generation of Americans to rise up again, for an amoral economic system has turned short-term profits for huge multi-national corporations into a false god. And this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the well-being of we the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live.",Candidate,female,2,1,13

John Delaney,NA,"Folks, we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for all, free everything and impossible promises that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected. That's what happened with McGovern. That's what happened with Mondale. That's what happened with Dukakis. Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal health care for every American with choice, someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere. And then we win the White House.",Candidate,male,2,1,17
John Delaney,NA,"I'm the product of the American dream. I believe in it. I'm the grandson of immigrants, the son of a construction worker. My wife April and I have four amazing daughters.

Tim Ryan,NA,"America is great, but not everyone can access America's greatness. The systems that were built to lift us up are now suffocating the American people.

Tim Ryan,NA,"Most families, when they go to sit at the kitchen table to do their bills, they get a pit in the middle of their stomach. We deserve better. And the political system is broken, too, because the entire conversation is about left or right, where are you at on the political system? And I'm here to say this isn't about left or right. This is about new and better. And it's not about reforming old systems. It's about building new systems.",Candidate,male,2,1,21

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That's because we come from a country of shared dreams, and I have had it with the racist attacks.

Are you also, quote, ""with Bernie"" on Medicare for all when it comes to raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it?",Moderator,male,2,1,98

Pete Buttigieg,NA,So we don't have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option will be better or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options. We can put it to the test.,Candidate,male,2,1,118
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"That's the concept of my Medicare for All Who Want It proposal. That way, if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive, but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option, and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off their insurance.",Candidate,male,2,1,119
Pete Buttigieg,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,2,1,120

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I think you can buy into it. That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"The answer is no. The middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class health care.

Steve Bullock,NA,"You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any place actually in the world. We got nothing to show for it. Negotiate prescription drug prices. End surprise medical billing.

Jake Tapper,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, you can respond. Congressman O'Rourke, you can respond.",Moderator,male,2,1,139
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need, as the example that Senator Warren showed us.",Candidate,male,2,1,140

Do you just not lack the will to fight for it?",Moderator,male,2,1,145

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. That's what Barack Obama wanted, and it would bring health care costs down for everyone.",Candidate,female,2,1,147
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And by the way, I just don't buy this. I've heard some of these candidates say that it's somehow not moral if you -- not moral to not have that public option.

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly, and I want to get things done. People can't wait.

Elizabeth Warren,NA,... we have tried this experiment with the insurance companies. And what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system. And they force people to have to fight to try to get the health care coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need.,Candidate,female,2,1,194
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Why does everybody -- why does every doctor, why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms? It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients.",Candidate,female,2,1,195
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,1,196
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,2,1,197
Elizabeth Warren,NA,That's what we have to fight.,Candidate,female,2,1,198
Jake Tapper,NA,"I want to bring in Marianne Williamson. Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to the criticism from Senator Warren that you're not willing to fight for Medicare for All?",Moderator,male,2,1,199
Marianne Williamson,NA,I don't know if Senator Warren said that about me specifically. I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said.,Candidate,female,2,1,200
Marianne Williamson,NA,"But I have to say, I have -- I'm normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one. I hear the others. And I have some concern about that, as well. And I do have concern about what the Republicans would say. And that's not just a Republican talking point. I do have concern that it will be difficult. I have concern that it will make it harder to win, and I have a concern that it'll make it harder to govern. Because if that's our big fight, then --",Candidate,female,2,1,201
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you Ms. Williamson.,Moderator,male,2,1,202
Marianne Williamson,NA,The Republicans will so shut us down on everything else.,Candidate,female,2,1,203

Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,1,206
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"If it's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they're going to do? They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.",Candidate,male,2,1,207
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So let's just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it. That's the policy I'm putting forward, not because I think it's the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there -- because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here -- whose life was saved by the ACA, but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her --",Candidate,male,2,1,208
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you Mayor Buttigieg, Senator Sanders your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,209
Bernie Sanders,NA,Let's be clear what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions.,Candidate,male,2,1,210
Bernie Sanders,NA,"That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid one-tenth the price in Canada for insulin that they're paying in the United States --",Candidate,male,2,1,211
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you Senator. I want to bring in Congressman Tim Ryan, Congressman Ryan your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,212
Tim Ryan,NA,"So here we are in Detroit, home of the United Auto workers. We have all our union friends here tonight. This plan that's being offered by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders will tell those Union members who gave away wages in order to get good healthcare that they're going to lose their healthcare because Washington's going to come in and tell them they got a better plan.",Candidate,male,2,1,213
Tim Ryan,NA,"This is the left and right thing -- new and better is this, move Medicare down to 50. Allow people to buy-in, Kaiser Permanente said that if they -- those 60 million people do that, they will see --",Candidate,male,2,1,214
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you Congressman.,Moderator,male,2,1,215
Tim Ryan,NA,A 40 percent reduction --,Candidate,male,2,1,216
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you Congressman.,Moderator,male,2,1,217
Tim Ryan,NA,"In their healthcare cost, let businesses buy-in, Jake --",Candidate,male,2,1,218
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you Congressman. So Senator, let's talk about that. If Medicare for all is enacted, there are more than 600,000 union members here in Michigan who would be forced to give up their private healthcare plans.",Moderator,male,2,1,219
Jake Tapper,NA,"Now, I understand that it would provide universal coverage -- but, can you guarantee those union members that the benefits under Medicare for all will be as good as the benefits that they're representatives -- their union reps fought hard to negotiate?",Moderator,male,2,1,220
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well two things, they will be better because Medicare for all is comprehensive -- it covers all healthcare needs. For senior citizens it will finally include dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses.",Candidate,male,2,1,221
Tim Ryan,NA,"But you don't know that -- you don't know that, Bernie.",Candidate,male,2,1,222
Bernie Sanders,NA,Second of all --,Candidate,male,2,1,223
Jake Tapper,NA,"I'll come to you in a second, Congressman.",Moderator,male,2,1,224
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I do know it, I wrote the damn bill. And second of all, second of all -- many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles and copayments when we do Medicare for all, instead of having the company putting money in to healthcare, they can get decent wage increases, which they're not getting today.",Candidate,male,2,1,225
Jake Tapper,NA,I want to bring in Congressman Ryan to respond to what Senator Sanders just said.,Moderator,male,2,1,226
Tim Ryan,NA,"I mean, Senator Sanders does not know all of the union contracts in the United States. I'm trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs, their wages have been stagnant, the world is crumbling around them -- the only thing they have is possibly really good healthcare.",Candidate,male,2,1,227
Tim Ryan,NA,"And the Democratic message is going to be, we're going to go in and the only thing you have left we're going to take it and we're going to do better. I do not think that's a recipe for success for us, it's bad policy and it's certainly bad politics.",Candidate,male,2,1,228
Jake Tapper,NA,Congressman Delaney.,Moderator,male,2,1,229
John Delaney,NA,"So the bill that Senator Sanders drafted, by definition will lower quality in healthcare, because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current Medicare rates. And the data is clear, Medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare, it covers 80 percent of the costs of healthcare in this country.",Candidate,male,2,1,230
John Delaney,NA,"And private insurance covers 120 percent, so if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers, you're going to create a two tier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash, and the people who are forced -- like my dad, the union electrician --",Candidate,male,2,1,231
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you Congressman.,Moderator,male,2,1,232
John Delaney,NA,Will have that healthcare plan taken away from him --,Candidate,male,2,1,233
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you Congressman --,Moderator,male,2,1,234
John Delaney,NA,They will be forced into an underfunded system.,Candidate,male,2,1,235
Jake Tapper,NA,I want to give Senator Sanders -- I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond.,Moderator,male,2,1,236
Bernie Sanders,NA,"On the Medicare for all, the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they're not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.",Candidate,male,2,1,237
Bernie Sanders,NA,Second of all --,Candidate,male,2,1,238
John Delaney,NA,"I've done the math, it doesn't add up.",Candidate,male,2,1,239
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare, but our job is to run a nonprofit healthcare system. Furthermore -- furthermore, when we say $500 billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy trying to deal with the health insurance companies --",Candidate,male,2,1,240
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you Senator.,Moderator,male,2,1,241
Bernie Sanders,NA,Hospitals will be better off than they are today.,Candidate,male,2,1,242
Jake Tapper,NA,"Congressman Delaney, I want to let you have a chance to respond.",Moderator,male,2,1,243
John Delaney,NA,"Listen, his math is wrong. That's all I'm saying -- that his math is wrong, it's been well-documented that if all the bills were paid at Medicare rate, which is specifically -- I think it's in section 1,200 of their bill, then many hospitals in this country would close.",Candidate,male,2,1,244
John Delaney,NA,"I've been going around rural America, and I ask rural hospital administrators one question, ""If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year, what would happen?""",Candidate,male,2,1,245
John Delaney,NA,"And they all look at me and say, ""We would close.""",Candidate,male,2,1,246
John Delaney,NA,"But the question is, why do we have to be so extreme? Why can't we just give everyone health care as a right, and allow them to have choice?",Candidate,male,2,1,247

Dana Bash,NA,We're going to move on to the issue of immigration now. There is...,Moderator,female,2,1,254
Dana Bash,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,2,1,255
Dana Bash,NA,"... widespread agreement on this stage on the need for immigration reform, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers. But there are some areas of disagreement.",Moderator,female,2,1,256
Dana Bash,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you're in favor of getting rid of the law that makes it a crime to come across the U.S. border illegally. Why won't that just encourage more illegal immigration?",Moderator,female,2,1,257
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When I am president, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law. But we've got a crisis on our hands. And it's not just a crisis of immigration; it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America.",Candidate,male,2,1,258
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Americans want comprehensive immigration reform. And frankly, we've been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime, protections for DREAMers; making sure that -- that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented; cleaning up lawful immigration.",Candidate,male,2,1,259
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We know what to do. We know that border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws. The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington. And now we have a president who could fix it in a month, because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.",Candidate,male,2,1,260
Dana Bash,NA,"But just a point of clarification, you did raise your hand in the last debate. You do want to decriminalize crossing the border illegally?",Moderator,female,2,1,261
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So in my view, if fraud is involved, then that's suitable for the criminal statute. If not, then it should be handled under civil law. But these show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being covered.",Candidate,male,2,1,262
Dana Bash,NA,"Well, we're not -- we're not doing that here.",Moderator,female,2,1,263

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I do, because, in my administration, after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9 million of our fellow Americans; freed DREAMers from any fear of deportation; and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge; end for-profit detention in this country; and then assist...",Candidate,male,2,1,268

Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Congressman.",Moderator,female,2,1,271
Dana Bash,NA,"Senator Warren, you say the provision making illegal border crossings a crime is totally unnecessary. Please respond.",Moderator,female,2,1,272
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So the problem is that, right now, the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents. It's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders.",Candidate,female,2,1,273
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We need to continue to have border security, and we can do that, but what we can't do is not live our values. I've been down to the border. I have seen the mothers.

John Hickenlooper,NA,"I agree that we need secure borders. There's no question about that. And the frustration with what's going on in Washington is they're kicking the ball back and forth.

John Hickenlooper,NA,"We've got -- I don't know -- on the two debate nights, we've got 170 years of Washington experience. Somehow it seems like that should be fairly fixable.",Candidate,male,2,1,287

If we decriminalize entry, if we give health care to everyone, we'll have multiples of that. Don't take my word, that was President Obama's Homeland Security secretary that said that.",Candidate,male,2,1,315
Steve Bullock,NA,"The biggest problem right now that we have with immigration, it's Donald Trump. He's using immigration to not only rip apart families, but rip apart this country.

Tim Ryan,NA,"And even if you decriminalize, which we should not do, you still have statutory authority. The president could still use his authority to separate families.

We're a strong enough country to be able to welcome them.",Candidate,male,2,1,341

John Hickenlooper,NA,"And we decided, you know, that we were going to go out and take on the NRA, and we passed as a purple state. We passed universal background checks. We limited magazine capacity.

Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Governor. Senator Klobuchar, please respond.",Moderator,male,2,1,372
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Yes, this isn't just about a system, or it's not just about words. This is about the NRA. I sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland, because I've been a leader on these issues and have the will to close to a boyfriend loophole.",Candidate,female,2,1,373
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I watched and wrote down when, nine times, he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day, he goes and he meets with the NRA, and he folds. As your president, I will not fold. I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapon ban, that we do something about magazines, and that we understand when 6 little - little 6-year-old boy died, Stephen Romero, when his dad said he's only 6 years old, all I can -",Candidate,female,2,1,374

I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We better not allow there to be a third. Something is broken if it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do. They won't prevent every incident. They won't save every life. But we know what to do, and it has not happened.",Candidate,male,2,1,379

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"After Parkland, those students just didn't march. They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family, and they said there must be a better way. Then we elected people in the House of Representatives. And guess what? It changed, and they passed universal background checks. And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell's doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president, I will take them on.",Candidate,female,2,1,383

Steve Bullock,NA,"You know, like 40 percent of American households, I'm a gun-owner. I hunt. Like far too many people in America, I've been personally impacted by gun violence. Had an 11-year-old nephew, Jeremy, shot and killed on a playground.",Candidate,male,2,1,389
Steve Bullock,NA,"We need to start looking at this as a public health issue, not a political issue. I agree with Senator Klobuchar. It is the NRA. And it's not just gun violence. It's when we talked about climate, when we talk about prescription drug costs, Washington, D.C., is captured by dark money, the Koch brothers, and others.",Candidate,male,2,1,390
Steve Bullock,NA,"That's been the fight of my career. Kicking the Koch brothers out of Montana, taking the first case after Citizens United up to the Supreme Court, making it so that elections are about people. That's the way we're actually going to make a change on this, Don, is by changing that system. And most of the things that folks are talking about on this stage we're not going to address until we kick dark money and the post-Citizens United corporate spending out of these elections.",Candidate,male,2,1,391
Don Lemon,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,392
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are, and yet nothing has changed? It is because, in this country, money buys influence, access, and, increasingly, outcomes.",Candidate,male,2,1,393
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place.

Do you still agree with that statement today?",Moderator,male,2,1,397
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I think we have got to do -- I think what I meant is what President Obama said, in that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have a magical solution to the crisis.",Candidate,male,2,1,398
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And as president I suspect it will be an F record. What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA.",Candidate,male,2,1,399
Bernie Sanders,NA,"You asked me about my record. Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but to expand and create universal background checks, do away with the strawman provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.",Candidate,male,2,1,400
Don Lemon,NA,"Yeah. Mayor Buttigieg, your response.",Moderator,male,2,1,401
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money out of politics. But when I propose the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference, end the Electoral College, amend the Constitution, if necessary, to clear up Citizens United, have D.C. actually be a state, and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny, as if this country were incapable of structural reform.",Candidate,male,2,1,402
Pete Buttigieg,NA,Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.,Candidate,male,2,1,403

Don Lemon,NA,"Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to this issue of gun safety?",Moderator,male,2,1,415
Marianne Williamson,NA,"The issue of gun safety, of course, is that the NRA has us in a chokehold, but so do the pharmaceutical companies, so do the health insurance companies, so do the fossil fuel companies, and so do the defense contractors, and none of this will change until we either pass a constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns.",Candidate,female,2,1,416
Marianne Williamson,NA,"But for politicians, including my fellow candidates, who themselves have taken tens of thousands -- and in some cases, hundreds of thousands -- of dollars from these same corporate donors to think that they now have the moral authority to say we're going to take them on, I don't think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada, yada, yada.",Candidate,female,2,1,417
Marianne Williamson,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,1,418

John Hickenlooper,NA,"I'm saying the policies of -- this notion that you're going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who, many of them don't want to give -- many of them do want to get rid of it, but some don't -- many don't.",Candidate,male,2,1,427

Steve Bullock,NA,"But this isn't just a choice between the left and the center. It's not a choice just between sort of these wish list economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win. What folks want is a fair shot.

John Delaney,NA,"Well, first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate, like universal health care, guaranteed government jobs, and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do.",Candidate,male,2,1,522
John Delaney,NA,"My plan, which gets us to net zero by 2050, which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids, will get us there. I put a price on carbon, take all the money, give it back to the American people in a dividend. That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis. It's the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress.",Candidate,male,2,1,523
John Delaney,NA,"I'm going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold, because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem. I'm going to create a market for something called direct air capture, which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere, because I don't think we'll get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things. I'm going to increase investment in renewables and I'm going to create something called the Climate Corps.",Candidate,male,2,1,524
John Delaney,NA,That is a plan that's realistic. It's a bet on the U.S. private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to net zero by 2050 for our kids.,Candidate,male,2,1,525
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Congressman. Senator Warren, you're a cosponsor of the Green New Deal. Your response to Congressman Delaney?",Moderator,female,2,1,526
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world. It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create.",Candidate,female,2,1,527
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I've proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it, so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest.",Candidate,female,2,1,528

John Hickenlooper,NA,"Well, I think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem. It's a distraction.",Candidate,male,2,1,536
John Hickenlooper,NA,"I share the urgency of everyone up here. We have to recognize -- I mean, everyone's got good ideas. What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice, right? It's what we do here is a best practice and a template, but it's got to be done all over the world.",Candidate,male,2,1,537
John Hickenlooper,NA,"So we've got to be building bridges right now with people like China, who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property. We need to work on that, but not with a tariff system. We need every country working together if we're going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.",Candidate,male,2,1,538
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you. Senator Warren, your response?",Moderator,female,2,1,539
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing. There's going to be a $23 trillion worldwide market for this. This could revitalize huge cities across this country. And no one wants to talk about it. What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say, ""Oh, we don't really have to do anything.""",Candidate,female,2,1,540

Dana Bash,NA,"Senator Sanders is co-sponsoring a bill that would eliminate new gas-powered car sales by 2040. Given the number of auto manufacturing workers in your state, how concerned are you about Senator Sanders' plan?",Moderator,female,2,1,545
Tim Ryan,NA,"Well, if we get our act together, we won't have to worry about it. I -- my plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the United States again, that would pull the government, the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, work with the private sector, work with investors, emerging tech companies, to dominate the electric vehicle market.",Candidate,male,2,1,546
Tim Ryan,NA,"China dominates it now, 50 percent to 60 percent. I want us to dominate the battery market, make those here in the United States and cut the workers in on the deal. The charging stations, solar panels, same thing; China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market.",Candidate,male,2,1,547
Tim Ryan,NA,"So this person will work in the White House, report directly to me, and we're going to start making things again.",Candidate,male,2,1,548

Tim Ryan,NA,... from all the subsidies that we're giving the farmers. They haven't made a profit in five years. And we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities.

Tim Ryan,NA,"All I'm saying is we have to invent our way out of this thing. And if we're waiting for 2040 for a ban to come in on gasoline vehicles, we're screwed. So we better get busy now. And that's why I'm saying get a chief manufacturing officer, align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives, and make sure that people can actually make money off of the new technologies that are moving forward.",Candidate,male,2,1,570

Steve Bullock,NA,"And second of which, as we transition to this clean energy economy, you've got to recognize, there are folks that have spent their whole life powering our country, and far too often, Democrats sound like they're part of the problem.

So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition. All right. We can create what the Green New Deal is about. It's a bold idea. We can create millions of good-paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker.

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Thank you Dana, and I was just in Flint. And they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous. So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue. It's a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams.",Candidate,female,2,1,608
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think the Governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, ""fix the damn roads,"" and it is an issue for union jobs. And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that's promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers. And then he hasn't followed through -- he has done nothing, he blew up a meeting at the White House.",Candidate,female,2,1,609
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I would put $1 trillion in to this, and I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind, but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised.",Candidate,female,2,1,610
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I would take that money and put it in to rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood -- that was African-American neighborhood that was most-hit when you had those recent rainstorms.",Candidate,female,2,1,611

Marianne Williamson,NA,"We need to say it like it is, it's bigger than Flint -- it's all over this country, it's particularly people of color -- it's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We'll call his racism out for what it is, and also talk about its consequences. It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say ""send her back,"" about a member of Congress, because she's a woman color, because she's a Muslim-American doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants ""rapists and criminals,"" or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that's comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith.",Candidate,male,2,1,623

And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop.",Candidate,female,2,1,657
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it.

Marianne Williamson,NA,"What makes me qualified to say $200 billion to $500 billion? I'll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there was 4 million to 5 million slaves at the end of the Civil War, four to five -- and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four, if you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than $100 billion is an insult.",Candidate,female,2,1,674
Marianne Williamson,NA,"And I believe that $200 billion to $500 billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface, an emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.",Candidate,female,2,1,675

Don Lemon,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,1,677
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, you don't think cash payments are the best way to address this issue, but according to a new Gallup poll, 73 percent of African-Americans are in favor of cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves. How do you respond to them?",Moderator,male,2,1,678
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation, which is called 10-20-30. And what that understands is that as a result of slavery, and segregation, and the institutional racism we see now in health care, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities.",Candidate,male,2,1,679
Bernie Sanders,NA,"In terms of education, I also have a plan. It's called the Thurgood Marshall Plan. And it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for Title I schools. It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.",Candidate,male,2,1,680

Don Lemon,NA,Let's turn now to the economy.,Moderator,male,2,1,685
Don Lemon,NA,"Congressman Ryan, President Trump's tariffs have boosted the U.S. steel industry but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in Michigan, which could drive up the cost of cars. As president, would you continue President Trump's steel tariffs?",Moderator,male,2,1,686
Tim Ryan,NA,"Look, I think President Trump was onto something when he talked about China. China has been abusing the economic system for a long time. They steal intellectual property. They subsidize goods coming into this country. They've displaced steel workers, auto workers, across the board, eroded our manufacturing. And we basically transferred our wealth of our middle class either up to the top 1 percent or to China for them to build their military.",Candidate,male,2,1,687
Tim Ryan,NA,So I think we need some targeted response against China. But you know how you beat China? You out-compete 'em. And that's why I'd put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base.,Candidate,male,2,1,688
Tim Ryan,NA,"We've got to fill these factories that -- in Detroit, in Youngstown, that used to make cars and steel. We've got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles, batteries, charging stations, make sure they're making solar panels.",Candidate,male,2,1,689
Tim Ryan,NA,"As I said earlier, China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market. They dominate 50 percent to 60 percent of the electric vehicle market. We're going to make 10 million electric vehicle somewhere in the world in the next 10 years. I want them made in the United States. That's why I have a chief manufacturing officer that will sit in the White House and help drive this agenda.",Candidate,male,2,1,690
Don Lemon,NA,"Congressman, thank you. Just as a point of clarification, as president, would you consider President Trump's steel tariffs, yes or no?",Moderator,male,2,1,691
Tim Ryan,NA,"Well, I would have to re-evaluate. I think some of them are effective. But he's bungled the whole thing, obviously. He has -- see, here's the problem with President Trump. He has a tactical move -- one of many -- he has a tactical move. What's the grand strategy for the United States? China has 100-year plan, a 50-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 20-year plan. We live in a 24-hour news cycle. That spells disaster for our economy and disaster for our global politics.",Candidate,male,2,1,692

Don Lemon,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,1,694
John Delaney,NA,"So, listen. This is what I don't understand. President Trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants. Most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on President Obama. I'm the only one running for president who actually supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama was right about that. We should be getting back in that.",Candidate,male,2,1,695
John Delaney,NA,Senator Warren just issued a trade plan...,Candidate,male,2,1,696

Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Congressman Delaney. Senator Warren, please respond.",Moderator,male,2,1,701
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, for decades, we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant multi-national corporations to help giant multi-national corporations. They have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they'll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam, they'll do it in a heartbeat.",Candidate,female,2,1,702
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we're not going to do it that way. We're going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table, with human rights activists at the table. And then, we're going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets. They want to sell to you...",Candidate,female,2,1,703

Don Lemon,NA,"Congressman Delaney, it's your turn. Thank you, Senator. Congressman Delaney?",Moderator,male,2,1,712
John Delaney,NA,So that was the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think President Obama was right. He did include environmental standards. He did include labor standards. We would be in an entirely different position with China if we had entered the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,Candidate,male,2,1,713
John Delaney,NA,"We can't isolate ourselves from the world. We can't isolate ourselves from Asia. Senator Warren's plan, basically, that she put out, we would not be able to trade with the United Kingdom.",Candidate,male,2,1,714
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"No, what this is about...",Candidate,female,2,1,715
John Delaney,NA,We would not be able to trade with the E.U. It is so extreme that it will isolate...,Candidate,male,2,1,716

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Oh, I'm sorry.",Candidate,male,2,1,724
Bernie Sanders,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,2,1,725
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers. American workers want those jobs, and we can build the trade deals that do it.",Candidate,female,2,1,726
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is, let's make them raise their standards. Make them pay workers more. Let their workers unionize. Raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products.",Candidate,female,2,1,727
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Right now, the whole game is working for the big multinationals. It's just not working for the people here in the United States, and we can change that.",Candidate,female,2,1,728
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator, thank you very much. Congressman O'Rourke, your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,729
Don Lemon,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,1,730
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"You know, the question was about tariffs. And they're a huge mistake. They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences.",Candidate,male,2,1,731
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"When have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies and friends and partners? As president, we will hold China accountable, but we will bring our allies and friends, like the European Union, to bear, and we'll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor, not just here in the United States...",Candidate,male,2,1,732
Don Lemon,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, thank you so much. Senator Sanders, please respond to Congressman O'Rourke.",Moderator,male,2,1,733
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I'd like to respond to this.,Candidate,female,2,1,734
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Yeah, OK. You're looking, I believe, at the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which cost us over 4 million jobs, but also helped lead the effort against these agreements.",Candidate,male,2,1,735
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right. If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you're mistaken. If they can save five cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or anyplace else, that's exactly what they will do.",Candidate,male,2,1,736
Bernie Sanders,NA,"As president, let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough. They want military contracts. They want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration, you ain't going to get those contracts if you're throwing American workers out on the street.",Candidate,male,2,1,737
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Sanders, thank you very much. Governor Hickenlooper, your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,738
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I'd like a chance to respond.,Candidate,female,2,1,739
John Hickenlooper,NA,"So -- so I think -- again, I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here. And there is a way of looking at trade that is therapeutic.",Candidate,male,2,1,740
John Hickenlooper,NA,"The bottom line is, you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner. Trade wars are for losers. And the bottom line is we've got to recognize, let's negotiate a better trade deal. But you're not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got 25 percent of our total debt.",Candidate,male,2,1,741
John Hickenlooper,NA,"And step back and look it. Here's Trump gives a giant tax cut and at the same time -- so we're paying in tariffs about $800 to $1,200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich. Essentially what's happening is now he's transferred that tax obligation onto the middle class. That's what's outrageous. But tariffs are not the solution.",Candidate,male,2,1,742
Don Lemon,NA,"Governor, thank you. Senator Warren?",Moderator,male,2,1,743
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0. What's the central feature? It's to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits.",Candidate,female,2,1,744
Elizabeth Warren,NA,That's what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.,Candidate,female,2,1,745
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator, thank you. Governor Bullock, your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,746
Steve Bullock,NA,"You know, a farmer in Rippy said to me, every time that Trump tweets, we lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. If Montana had to eat all the wheat that we produce, every Montanan would have to eat 40 loaves of bread a day.",Candidate,male,2,1,747
Steve Bullock,NA,"But by the same token, what we have is -- I actually agree with Senator Warren on this in part. Corporations can move capital easy. Workers can't move. So going forward, we need to make sure that our trade deals actually are protecting -- thinking about the workers. They can't be the stepchild. But the way to do it, with this blunt instrument of tariffs that the president is doing, that's not how we get a fair deal for farmers anywhere or the manufacturers here in Detroit.",Candidate,male,2,1,748
Don Lemon,NA,"Governor, thank you very much.",Moderator,male,2,1,749
Don Lemon,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,2,1,750
Don Lemon,NA,"Mayor -- standby, please. Standby, please. Please abide by the rules. Mayor Buttigieg, on Thursday of this week, a GM plant in Michigan will stop production, the latest auto plant to cease operations in the industrial Midwest. This comes as part of the company's modernization plans, which will eventually result in 6,000 hourly workers losing their jobs or being reassigned to other plants.",Moderator,male,2,1,751
Don Lemon,NA,What is your plan for retraining workers whose jobs are at risk?,Moderator,male,2,1,752
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, this happened in my community 20 years before I was born. And when I was growing up, we were still picking up the pieces. Empty factories, empty houses, poverty. I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place. And there will be more.",Candidate,male,2,1,753
Pete Buttigieg,NA,It's why we actually need to put the interests of workers first. Of course we need to do retraining. We're doing it now in South Bend. We should continue to do it. But this is so much bigger than a trade fight. This is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes.,Candidate,male,2,1,754
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week than my parents went through in their lifetime. It's why I've proposed that we allow gig workers to unionize, because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.",Candidate,male,2,1,755

And, you know, in addition to confronting tech, in addition to supporting workers by double unionization, as I propose to do, some of this is low-tech, too, like the minimum wage is just too low. And so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage, when scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.",Candidate,male,2,1,758

Don Lemon,NA,"Mayor, thank you very much.",Moderator,male,2,1,760
Don Lemon,NA,"Congressman Delaney, I'm coming to you now. Your estimated net worth is more than $65 million. That would make you subject to Senator Warren's proposed wealth tax on the assets of the richest 75,000 homes, households, or so, in the United States. Do you think Senator Warren's wealth tax is a fair way to fund child care and education?",Moderator,male,2,1,761
John Delaney,NA,"I think wealthy Americans have to pay more. Listen, I grew up in a blue-collar family. First in my family to go to college. Became a successful entrepreneur. Created thousands of jobs. Supported thousands of entrepreneurs all around this country. And I've done well financially. I think I should pay more in tax. I think wealthy Americans should pay more in tax. But we have to have a real solution.",Candidate,male,2,1,762
John Delaney,NA,The real solution is to raise the capital gains rates. There is no reason why people who invest for a living should pay less than people who work for a living. That's ridiculous. It's the biggest loophole in our tax code.,Candidate,male,2,1,763
John Delaney,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,1,764
John Delaney,NA,"We act like wealthy individuals are endangered species and if we don't raise -- if we raise their taxes, they won't invest. That's crazy. That's how we get more revenues from wealthy individuals, we roll back the Trump tax cuts to wealthy individuals.",Candidate,male,2,1,765
John Delaney,NA,"I think the wealth tax will be fought in court forever. It's arguably unconstitutional. And the countries that have had it have largely abandoned it because it's impossible to implement. But here again, real solutions, not impossible promises.",Candidate,male,2,1,766

Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Warren, please respond.",Moderator,male,2,1,771
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I have proposed a wealth tax. It's now time to do that. It's time to tax the top one tenth of one percent of fortunes in this country. Your first $50 million, you can keep free and clear. But your 50 millionth and first dollar, you got to pitch in two cents. Two cents.",Candidate,female,2,1,772
Elizabeth Warren,NA,What can America do with two cents? We can provide universal childcare from zero to five. We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. We can provide universal tuition-free college. We can expand Pell. We can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America.,Candidate,female,2,1,773

John Delaney,NA,We can raise the capital gains rate to match the ordinary income. You know the last president to do that was actually Ronald Reagan. We can do that in our first year. I've called for that to be done (inaudible). I've called for the expansion of universal pre-K so that every American has pre-K. And I do it through a -- through an additional tax on high net worth individuals.,Candidate,male,2,1,782

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"That would be great for us. And then the next day, there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren't -- why they weren't lucky enough in timing to get theirs wiped away completely, too.",Candidate,male,2,1,794
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We can have debt-free college for low and middle-income students by expanding Pell Grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden. And on the back end, for those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.",Candidate,male,2,1,795
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair. If we want to start wiping away student debt, here's where I would start. I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people, especially veterans, by the way. The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges. Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they delivered results. President Trump, under a secretary of education who regrettably is from this state, did away with those rules. There's no accountability.",Candidate,male,2,1,796
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"On my watch, those colleges that turned the Department of Education into a predatory lender, that's where we would begin when it came to getting rid of loans.",Candidate,male,2,1,797

Bernie Sanders,NA,"You've got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. You have a top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent.

And we've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.",Candidate,male,2,1,801

Dana Bash,NA,You are proposing to make college free for all qualified students. Should the government pay for children from wealthier families to go to college?,Moderator,female,2,1,806
Marianne Williamson,NA,"I think that all domestic and international policy should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy. That's how you stimulate your economy. So if a few people take advantage, but there are four or five people who were going to take the money that they then have in the bank -- when you look at this $1.5 trillion college debt -- this is why I agree with Bernie, or I would be -- OK, why don't we swap it? We had a $2 trillion tax cut, where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us, that does not stimulate the economy.",Candidate,female,2,1,807
Marianne Williamson,NA,"If we get rid of this college debt, think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending; they'll be able to start their business. The best thing you could do to stimulate the U.S. economy is to get rid of this debt.",Candidate,female,2,1,808

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I support free two-year college, earn that associate's degree, realize your full potential, debt-free four-year college. But unlike some of the other candidates on the stage, that's not just for tuition. That is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country, and then for that schoolteacher who, in many places like Texas, is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt, forgiveness for that person willing to work at the V.A. and serve our former service members.",Candidate,male,2,1,816

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I want to make it easier for kids to go to college. And I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most.

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I don't think that makes sense. And I'm very concerned if we do things like that, the debt we're going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation. So what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally -- over 5, 10 years -- can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don't have enough workers.",Candidate,female,2,1,821

And there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began. We're going to spend -- the Congress passed -- and I will not vote for -- a $715 billion military budget, more than the 10 next countries combined.",Candidate,male,2,1,827
Bernie Sanders,NA,"What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, ending conflicts by people sitting at a table, not by killing each other. As president of the United States, I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the U.N., but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully.",Candidate,male,2,1,828

Bernie Sanders,NA,The United States cannot be the policeman of the world.,Candidate,male,2,1,830
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Governor Hickenlooper, how do you respond to Senator Sanders' vision for America's role in the world?",Moderator,male,2,1,831
John Hickenlooper,NA,"Well, we share the recognition of the incredible costs. People don't realize that half the soldiers that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were National Guard. And so I went and sent them off on their deployments, big, you know, noisy hangers, but I also mourned with their families when they didn't come back.",Candidate,male,2,1,832
John Hickenlooper,NA,"We are able now to -- I call it constant engagement. But we should have an international diplomatic approach where we're talking to everybody, because if we're going to deal with climate change and cyber security and nuclear proliferation, we've got to be talking to everybody. And tariff wars don't work.",Candidate,male,2,1,833

Jake Tapper,NA,"I want to go to Congressman Ryan and I want to turn to the subject of North Korea, which just hours ago launched two short-range ballistic missiles for the second time in less than a week. Congressman, you've said that you would not meet with North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un unless you were at least close to a deal. Now, Senator Klobuchar says that she would, quote, ""always be willing to meet with leaders to discuss policies."" Is that view wrong?",Moderator,male,2,1,837
Tim Ryan,NA,"Yeah, I think so. I love Amy Klobuchar, but I think she's wrong on this one. I don't think presidents of the United States meet with dictators.",Candidate,male,2,1,838
Tim Ryan,NA,"We saw what just happened with President Trump. He goes to the demilitarized zone with the leader of North Korea, gives him a huge photo op, gives him global credibility, because the most powerful person in the world is sitting there meeting with him, and weeks later, he's lobbing more missiles. That doesn't make any sense.",Candidate,male,2,1,839
Tim Ryan,NA,"We've got to demilitarize our foreign policy. We've got to make sure that we are engaging these countries all the time. This is very difficult work. I've been in Congress 17 years. I've sat on the Defense Appropriations Committee. I've sat on the Armed Services Committee. This is long, tedious work, much of it done outside of the eye of the TV camera.",Candidate,male,2,1,840
Tim Ryan,NA,"And as president, you've got to monitor that and be very disciplined every day. Don't go give a dictator a huge win. Sit down and do your job.",Candidate,male,2,1,841

Jake Tapper,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,845
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think we agree. I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place. What I don't like is how this president has handled it. You've heard of the Truman doctrine, the Monroe doctrine. He's done the go-it-alone doctrine with the rest of the world.",Candidate,female,2,1,846
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"He's taking us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement, and I don't agree with that.",Candidate,female,2,1,847
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20, when he was asked about invading our democracy, he made a joke. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote.",Candidate,female,2,1,848

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And on my watch, I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three-year sunset and have to be renewed, because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve, members of Congress ought to have to summon the courage to vote on whether they ought to be there.",Candidate,male,2,1,863

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I would in my first term in office. Agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war, already in its 18th year, that will make it any better. We've satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place. And it's time to bring those servicemembers back home from Afghanistan, but also from Iraq, also from Yemen, and Somalia, and Libya, and Syria.",Candidate,male,2,1,867
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"There is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight. As president, I will end those wars, and we will not start new wars. We will not send more U.S. servicemembers overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name.

John Hickenlooper,NA,We're going to have to be in Afghanistan. Look at the progress that's happened in that country.

Jake Tapper,NA,"Senator Warren, you want to make it U.S. policy that the U.S. will never use a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first. Now, President Obama reportedly considered that policy, but ultimately decided against it. Why should the U.S. tie its own hands with that policy?",Moderator,male,2,1,878
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Because it makes the world safer. The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively, and we need to say so to the entire world. It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculates, someone misunderstands.",Candidate,female,2,1,879
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe. And what's happening right now with Donald Trump is they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they could be used puts us all at risk.",Candidate,female,2,1,880
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, we talk about what's happening around the world. I have three older brothers who served in the military. I see that they would do anything. Our military is the best on Earth. But we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution. We need to use our diplomatic tools, our economic tools, and if we're going to send someone into war, we better have a plan for how we're going to get them out on the other end.",Candidate,female,2,1,881

Steve Bullock,NA,"But by the same token, America's strength -- and, look, this president has made America first as America alone. Our allies no longer trust us. Our adversaries are with us. But going from the position of strength, we should be negotiating down so there aren't nuclear weapons. But drawing those lines in the sand, at this point I wouldn't do.",Candidate,male,2,1,885
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Governor. Senator Warren. your response?",Moderator,male,2,1,886
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, we don't expand trust around the world by saying, ""You know, we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon."" That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk, right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations, expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran, and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon, the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare.",Candidate,female,2,1,887

Steve Bullock,NA,"Part, I agree with. But by the same token, like, we need to get back to nuclear proliferation.",Candidate,male,2,1,891
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Why?,Candidate,female,2,1,892
Steve Bullock,NA,"But when you have folks -- de-proliferation, reducing it. But at the same time, when you actually have Korea; when you have others, I don't want to turn around and say, ""Well, Detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that."" When so many crazy folks are getting closer to having a nuclear weapon, I don't want them to think I could strike this country and I and we as the United States of America wouldn't do a thing.",Candidate,male,2,1,893

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"This is the kind of trend America might be leading, instead of following, but only if it's actually backed by the right vision. And we can have great presidents at any age. What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work. We have to be ready to take on this president and, by the way, something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers in Congress.",Candidate,male,2,1,906

And my vision, among other things, says that if we're going to fight for health care, we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies.",Candidate,male,2,1,913
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who, in my view, are going to war against the American people in terms of health care. That's a new vision.",Candidate,male,2,1,914

Marianne Williamson,NA,"And in order to do that, we need more than political insider game and wonkiness and intellectual argument. Those things will not defeat Donald Trump.

We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed.",Candidate,female,2,1,931
Marianne Williamson,NA,"Even on the subject of foreign policy, it's all about symptoms and not about cause. We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership. The fact that countries see us, not only domestically but internationally, with policies that simply support our corporate overlords. The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace-building.",Candidate,female,2,1,932
Marianne Williamson,NA,"There's some corruption that is so deep, ladies and gentlemen. And until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to the deeper corruption, knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated, than I'm afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home.",Candidate,female,2,1,933

Dana Bash,NA,"Senator Harris, this week you released a new health care plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in. Vice President Biden's campaign calls your plan, quote, ""a have-it-every-which-way approach"" and says it's just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your health care stance. What do you say to that?",Moderator,female,2,2,83
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, they're probably confused because they've not read it. But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families, listening to experts, listening to health care providers, and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people, responsive to their needs understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long, that American families have to be held down by deductibles and co-pays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.",Candidate,female,2,2,84
Kamala Harris,NA,"I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan, so I devised a plan where it's going to be 10 years of a transition.",Candidate,female,2,2,85
Kamala Harris,NA,"I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where, yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan, under my plan for Medicare, and a private plan, under my plan for Medicare.",Candidate,female,2,2,86
Kamala Harris,NA,"Because the bottom line is this: We must agree that access to health care must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people -- in fact, 30 million people -- are going without access to health care.",Candidate,female,2,2,87
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Biden, your response.",Moderator,female,2,2,88
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, my response is that the senator has had several plans so far. And any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years.",Candidate,male,2,2,89
Joe Biden,NA,"If you noticed, there is no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer-based insurance. And in fact, you know, this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.",Candidate,male,2,2,90
Dana Bash,NA,"Your response, Senator Harris?",Moderator,female,2,2,91
Kamala Harris,NA,"Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing. The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system.",Candidate,female,2,2,92
Kamala Harris,NA,"Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan, and right now, 4 million babies almost are born every day in America -- or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to health care.",Candidate,female,2,2,93
Kamala Harris,NA,"Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans. So I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to health care and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.",Candidate,female,2,2,94
Dana Bash,NA,"Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, your response?",Moderator,female,2,2,95
Joe Biden,NA,"The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion when it is, in fact, employed, number one. Ten years from now, after two terms of the senator being president, after her time.",Candidate,male,2,2,96
Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, it will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down. Thirdly, it will eliminate employer-based insurance. And fourthly, what happens in the meantime?",Candidate,male,2,2,97
Kamala Harris,NA,"I'd like to respond. First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. Second, we are now paying $3 trillion a year for health care in America. Over the next 10 years, it's probably going to be $6 trillion. We must act.",Candidate,female,2,2,98
Kamala Harris,NA,"My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage. Right now in America, we have seniors, who every day -- millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need. All people should have access to health care. And costs should not be their barrier.",Candidate,female,2,2,99

Bill de Blasio,NA,"There's this mythology that somehow all of these folks are in love with their insurance in America. What I hear from union members and from hard-working, middle-class people is they wish they had better insurance and they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental care...",Candidate,male,2,2,104

Dana Bash,NA,"Vice President Biden, you just heard Mayor de Blasio. He said in the past that Democrats who wanted to keep the private insurance industry are defending a health care system that is not working. What's your response?",Moderator,female,2,2,108
Joe Biden,NA,"My response is, Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and do -- take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into that option if they didn't like their employer plan, or if they're on Medicaid, they'd automatically be in the plan.",Candidate,male,2,2,109

I know whatever they're going to prescribe, whether it's an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it.",Candidate,female,2,2,114
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"The truth about health care in America today is people can't afford it. They cannot afford -- and the insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I'm sorry, they're for-profit companies. They have an obligation to their shareholders.

Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but they - if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance.",Candidate,male,2,2,129
Joe Biden,NA,"It says, if the 160 million who have it say they like their employer insurance, they should have a right to have it. If they don't, they can buy into the Biden plan, which is Obamacare with -",Candidate,male,2,2,130
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Senator Booker, let me bring you in here. You say you support Medicare for All. You also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for a government plan, but that's what Medicare for All would do.",Moderator,female,2,2,131
Dana Bash,NA,So how do you square that?,Moderator,female,2,2,132
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, let me just say, that the person that's enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other, while he is working right now to take away Americans' healthcare. There is a court case working through the system that's going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on preexisting conditions.",Candidate,male,2,2,133
Cory Booker,NA,"And so, I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me, always keep your eyes on the prize. And that is that in the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare, that it's a human right. And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way, just a handful of years of literally spending 20 percent of our economy, one out of every $5 spent on healthcare.",Candidate,male,2,2,134
Cory Booker,NA,"And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple mores than other countries - multiple more than other countries. And so, do you want to know what I'm going to do? I'm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for All - where everyone is covered.",Candidate,male,2,2,135
Cory Booker,NA,"But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here. And I'm -",Candidate,male,2,2,136
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,2,2,137
Dana Bash,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,2,2,138
Cory Booker,NA,- going to keep fighting for that.,Candidate,male,2,2,139
Dana Bash,NA,"Congressman Gabbard, what's your response?",Moderator,female,2,2,140
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"The reality is right now, we don't have a healthcare system. We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it. So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who've been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table, writing this legislation.",Candidate,female,2,2,141
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Now, Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill. This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal. Sebelius works for Medicare Advantage, a private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan. If we're seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.",Candidate,female,2,2,142
Dana Bash,NA,"Senior Harris, your response?",Moderator,female,2,2,143
Dana Bash,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,2,2,144
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, unfortunately, Representative Gabbard got it wrong. Kathleen Sebelius did not write my plan; she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to healthcare in America. And when we talk about this again, I'm going to back to Vice President Biden, because your plan does not cover everyone in America.",Candidate,female,2,2,145
Kamala Harris,NA,"By your staffs and your own definition, 10 million people - as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare. And in 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse. Our plan covers everyone -",Candidate,female,2,2,146
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,2,2,147
Kamala Harris,NA,- and gives people choice,Candidate,female,2,2,148
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, your response?",Moderator,female,2,2,149
Joe Biden,NA,"My plan does - will cover everyone, number one. Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices. The biopharma is now where things are going to go. It's no longer chemicals. It's about all these breakthroughs that we have, with the whole - excuse me, immune system.",Candidate,male,2,2,150
Joe Biden,NA,"And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in HHS and says, as you develop a drug, you got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for. We will set the price. And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on.",Candidate,male,2,2,151
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I want to bring in Senator Bennet. Last night, on this stage, one of your democratic rivals suggested that running on Medicare for All would get Donald Trump reelected.",Moderator,male,2,2,152
Michael Bennet,NA,"I agree that it makes it much more likely. Unlike others on this stage, I've been crystal clear of where I've been for a decade, through two tough races in Colorado. I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family, whether they want private insurance or public insurance.",Candidate,male,2,2,153
Michael Bennet,NA,"It requires the drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare and it provides competition. That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer based health insurance in this country and massively raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.",Candidate,male,2,2,154
Michael Bennet,NA,"As Joe Biden said, we don't need to do that. It doesn't make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and -- and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room when we pass a public option, trust the American people to make the right decision, and have universal healthcare in this country in two years, not 10 years.",Candidate,male,2,2,155
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, I want to bring you in ...",Moderator,male,2,2,156
Kamala Harris,NA,I -- I need to respond.,Candidate,female,2,2,157
Jake Tapper,NA,Your response. I'll come to you right after Secretary Castro. Secretary Castro.,Moderator,male,2,2,158
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans. You know I grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse. That whole time she had Medicare.",Candidate,male,2,2,159
Julian Castro,NA,I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe thought that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that.,Candidate,male,2,2,160
Julian Castro,NA,"What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine, in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not.",Candidate,male,2,2,161
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Secretary Castro. Senator Harris, Senator Bennet had suggested that you support banning employer based health insurance. Is that true?",Moderator,male,2,2,162
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well first of all, with all due respect to my friend, Michael Bennet, my plan does not offer anything that is illegal. What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be a -- where -- the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work.",Candidate,female,2,2,163
Kamala Harris,NA,"I have me met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like, where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides. It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get and under my plan; we do that as it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies ....",Candidate,female,2,2,164
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,2,2,165
Kamala Harris,NA,Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennet's plan ...,Candidate,female,2,2,166
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,2,2,167
Kamala Harris,NA,We will do that.,Candidate,female,2,2,168
Jake Tapper,NA,"Senator Bennet, I want to bring you back.",Moderator,male,2,2,169
Michael Bennet,NA,"Senator Harris is my friend as well, but I have to say if we can't admit -- if we can't admit tonight what's in the plan, which is banning employer based insurance, we're not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing democrats of doing that as well.",Candidate,male,2,2,170
Michael Bennet,NA,We need to be honest about what's in this plan. It bans employer based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion. Do you know how much that is? That is 70 percent of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years.,Candidate,male,2,2,171
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,2,2,172
Michael Bennet,NA,We don't need to do that.,Candidate,male,2,2,173
Michael Bennet,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,174
Michael Bennet,NA,We can have a public option to have universal healthcare in this country.,Candidate,male,2,2,175
Jake Tapper,NA,I do want to bring in Senator Harris because he just suggested you were not being honest.,Moderator,male,2,2,176
Kamala Harris,NA,"He -- we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this. You got to stop. The reality is that - what -- under my Medicare for All plan, yes, employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision.",Candidate,female,2,2,177
Kamala Harris,NA,"Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, will be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only. They want choice and my plan gives that to them.",Candidate,female,2,2,178
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank. Thank you, Senator. Governor Inslee, I want to bring you in. You recently signed a public option into law, which allows Washington State residents to purchase a state backed plan if they want to.",Moderator,male,2,2,179
Jake Tapper,NA,But this may only save families in Washington State as little as 5 percent off premiums. Is 5 percent really the kind of relief that the American people need?,Moderator,male,2,2,180
Jay Inslee,NA,"No, we need universal coverage. And I'm proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done. And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publically sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens.",Candidate,male,2,2,181
Jay Inslee,NA,"I'm also proud that we didn't stop there. We're also the first state that has taken care of our elders, our seniors. We have a looming retirement wave coming up. I'm proud that our state -- our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity.",Candidate,male,2,2,182
Jay Inslee,NA,"I'm also proud of this and I think we need to talk more about this as democrats, it is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country. And we are -- we are ...",Candidate,male,2,2,183
Jay Inslee,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,184
Jay Inslee,NA,We are having -- we've had some success in integrating mental health with physical health. There's no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health.,Candidate,male,2,2,185
Jay Inslee,NA,"And the last thing we're doing, I think it's very instructive for the nation. We know we're being eaten alive by pharmaceutical cost. We have had one of, if not the most, innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life saving medications in the United States.",Candidate,male,2,2,186
Jay Inslee,NA,"We have had one of, if not the most innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life-saving medications in the United States. That's a record of Washington state I'd like to take to Washington, D.C.",Candidate,male,2,2,187
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Governor Inslee.",Moderator,male,2,2,188
Jake Tapper,NA,"Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in. You support a Medicare for All system. How do you respond to Governor Inslee?",Moderator,male,2,2,189
Andrew Yang,NA,"Well, I just want to share a story. When I told my wife I was running for president, you know the first question she asked me? What are we going to do about our health care?",Candidate,male,2,2,190
Andrew Yang,NA,"That's a true story, and it's not just us. Democrats are talking about health care in the wrong way. As someone who's run a business, I can tell you flat out our current health care system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees, it makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and it's certainly a lot harder to start a business.",Candidate,male,2,2,191
Andrew Yang,NA,"If we say, look, we're going to get health care off the backs of businesses and families, then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom. That's the argument we should be making to the American people.",Candidate,male,2,2,192
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,193
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang.",Moderator,male,2,2,194
Jake Tapper,NA,Mayor de Blasio?,Moderator,male,2,2,195
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Yeah, I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fearmongering about universal health care. It makes no sense. Ask the American people, they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them. Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies. They feel it's holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need. They get a lot of noes. They don't get a lot of help from health insurance companies.",Candidate,male,2,2,196
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold, that says we don't need to be dependent on private insurance? We can have a system that actually covers everyone. You know what? Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo. How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people?",Candidate,male,2,2,197
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you. Mr. Mayor, just a 15-second point of clarification. Who are you talking about? Who's fearmongering?",Moderator,male,2,2,198
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what he's saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes. Americans right now are paying so much money for their health care, ask people about the reality of premiums, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket expenses.",Candidate,male,2,2,199
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,2,2,200
Bill de Blasio,NA,"That's worse than any tax, and people are paying that right now.",Candidate,male,2,2,201
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",Moderator,male,2,2,202
Jake Tapper,NA,Senator Bennet?,Moderator,male,2,2,203
Michael Bennet,NA,This -- this is -- this has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry. This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families and they can choose a public option.,Candidate,male,2,2,204
Michael Bennet,NA,"Bernie Sanders, who said last night he wrote the damn bill, and he did, just like I wrote the damn public option bill, is the guy who says it will cost $32 trillion and that we're going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it. He says that. Republicans don't say it. Don't try to district from the truth.",Candidate,male,2,2,205
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator Bennet.",Moderator,male,2,2,206
Michael Bennet,NA,You can't hide from the truth.,Candidate,male,2,2,207

Michael Bennet,NA,We need to be for universal health care.,Candidate,male,2,2,209
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Senator, if we as Democrats say we're done with private insurance, has only hurt the American people in so many ways, we're going to give them something that works for their family's full coverage that they can depend on. If we say that, then there's an election. The American people get to decide.",Candidate,male,2,2,210
Bill de Blasio,NA,"The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election, and this should be the party that stands for universal health care and says we're not going to accept anything less. Right now, in America, so many people don't have the health care they need. That is a fact. Tens of millions of people, including middle class people.",Candidate,male,2,2,211

Jake Tapper,NA,"Vice President Biden, your response, sir?",Moderator,male,2,2,215
Joe Biden,NA,"This is not a Republican talking point. The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare. Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat, 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. And in fact, what we got is a public option that, in fact, would allow anybody to buy in.",Candidate,male,2,2,216
Joe Biden,NA,"No one has to keep their private insurance. They can buy into this plan. And they can buy into it with $1,000 deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it. And if they don't have any money, they'll get in free. So this idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we're talking about here.",Candidate,male,2,2,217
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,218
Joe Biden,NA,"The fact of the matter is -- the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible. It will be a deductible on their paycheck. Bernie acknowledges it. Bernie acknowledges it. Thirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid. And I don't know what math you do in New York, I don't know what math you do in California, but I tell ya, that's a lot of money, and there will be a deductible. The deductible will be out of your paycheck, because that's what will be required.",Candidate,male,2,2,219
Jake Tapper,NA,"Senator Harris, I want to bring you in here. Your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,220
Jake Tapper,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,2,221
Kamala Harris,NA,"Yeah, let's talk about math. Let's talk about math. Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $72 billion, and that is on the backs of American families.",Candidate,female,2,2,222
Kamala Harris,NA,"And under your plan, status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families. In America today, diabetes patients, one in four cannot afford their insulin. In America today...",Candidate,female,2,2,223

We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like, no matter what one it is, and buy into a Medicare option.

How is he wrong?",Moderator,male,2,2,238
Julian Castro,NA,"Thank you for that question. You know, if you elect me president, you're not electing me to follow. You're electing me to lead.

Julian Castro,NA,"The only way that we're going to guarantee that we don't have family separations in this country again is to repeal Section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act. That is the law that this president, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.",Candidate,male,2,2,240
Julian Castro,NA,"My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who haven't committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship, that we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States.

Michael Bennet,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,264
Michael Bennet,NA,"That is what this administration has done in the American people's name. They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility.

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who we're talking about. When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence. A woman from El Salvador owned a small business, gangs came to her and said if you don't give us all your money, we're going to kill your family. That's why she fled.",Candidate,female,2,2,268

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,That's why she fled.,Candidate,female,2,2,270
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So this is who we're talking about -- and they're not criminals. So I believe that we should have a civil violation. No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it. Because he's using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars.",Candidate,female,2,2,271

Joe Biden,NA,"The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. That woman, the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.",Candidate,male,2,2,289
Joe Biden,NA,"With regard to -- with regard to the secretary's point, I already proposed and passed...",Candidate,male,2,2,290

Joe Biden,NA,"... $750 million for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place.",Candidate,male,2,2,292
Joe Biden,NA,"In addition to that, we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the United States and make their case, that they don't -- that they have to wait in line. The fact of the matter is, you should be able to -- if you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back. It's a crime. It's a crime, and it's not one that in fact...",Candidate,male,2,2,293

Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,297
Julian Castro,NA,"Let me begin by telling you -- let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that.",Candidate,male,2,2,298
Joe Biden,NA,I agree.,Candidate,male,2,2,299
Julian Castro,NA,"Secondly, the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. It's a civil action. Also, we have 654 miles of fencing. We have thousands of personnel at the border. We have planes; we have boats; we have helicopters; we have security cameras...",Candidate,male,2,2,300

Don Lemon,NA,"Mr. Vice President, please, your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,307
Joe Biden,NA,"I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense. Here's the deal. The fact of the matter is that, in fact, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum. People should have to get in line. That's the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.",Candidate,male,2,2,308
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,309
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard, what's your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,310
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who've been separated from their parents, when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions. This is about leadership and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies.",Candidate,female,2,2,311
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"We will have to stop separating children from their parents, make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.",Candidate,female,2,2,312
Don Lemon,NA,"Mr. Yang, your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,313
Don Lemon,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,2,314
Andrew Yang,NA,I'm the son of immigrants myself. My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 U.S. patents for G.E. and IBM. I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States. That's the immigration story we need to be telling.,Candidate,male,2,2,315
Andrew Yang,NA,"We can't always be focusing on some of the -- the -- the distressed stories. And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants; you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines. Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.",Candidate,male,2,2,316
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,317
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Booker you have a plan that would, quote, ""virtually eliminate immigration detention."" Does that mean that the roughly 55,000 migrants currently in detention would be released into the United States?",Moderator,male,2,2,318
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, I just want to say, again, tonight, we are playing into Republican hands who have a very different view, and they're trying to divide us against each other. I'm listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border. An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing, if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do in the criminal courts.",Candidate,male,2,2,319
Cory Booker,NA,"But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights. And so, doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to; seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children.",Candidate,male,2,2,320
Cory Booker,NA,"This is not necessary. We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100 percent compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned. If they are, like the people I met in Juarez, who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values -",Candidate,male,2,2,321
Don Lemon,NA,Senator -,Moderator,male,2,2,322
Cory Booker,NA,- and making ourselves less safe.,Candidate,male,2,2,323
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Booker, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,324
Joe Biden,NA,"I agree with the Senator. The asylum process is a real process, and this president is ruining it. It has nothing to do with that section of law. That's what he's doing, number one. Number two, we should in fact - and we had proposed and we tried to get passed in our administration, I proposed, significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come.",Candidate,male,2,2,325
Joe Biden,NA,This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people. And the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country. That's why we're so special. It took courage. It took resilience. It took absolutely confidence for them to come. And we should be encouraging these people.,Candidate,male,2,2,326
Don Lemon,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,2,2,327
Joe Biden,NA,"And by the way, anybody that crosses the stage with a - with a - with a PhD, you should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here.",Candidate,male,2,2,328
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Governor Inslee, what's your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,329
Jay Inslee,NA,"I think we're missing two central statements we need to make. Number one, we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House, number one.",Candidate,male,2,2,330
Jay Inslee,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,331
Jay Inslee,NA,"And number two - number two, we have to make America what it's always been, a place of refuge. We got to boost the number of people we accept. I'm proud of being the first governor saying send us your Syrian refugees. I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's Muslim ban. I'm proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row. I'm ready for November 2020.",Candidate,male,2,2,332
Jay Inslee,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,333
Don Lemon,NA,"Go ahead. Mayor de Blasio, please your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,334
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Two points. One, it's all kind of charade because there's 11 million people here, and everyone, in theory, has broken the law, but they're part of our communities now. They're part of our economy. They're our neighbors. Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or a criminal penalty, when it's an American reality?",Candidate,male,2,2,335
Bill de Blasio,NA,"And what we need is comprehensive immigration, once and for all, to fix it. Second, Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations. You were vice president of the United States. I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not, using your power, your influence in the White House. Do you think it was a good idea, or do you think it was something that needed to be stopped?",Candidate,male,2,2,336
Don Lemon,NA,Mr. Vice President -,Moderator,male,2,2,337
Joe Biden,NA,"The president came along, and he's the guy that came up with the idea the first time ever, dealing with the dreamers. He put that in the law. He had talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the - laid before the Congress, saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring in to this country.",Candidate,male,2,2,338
Joe Biden,NA,"Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place. So he did - to compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre.",Candidate,male,2,2,339
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Congresswoman Gabbard, you are a co-sponsor of the College for All Act which would make public colleges and universities free for all Americans. One of the authors of that plan, Senator Sanders, believes college should be tuition-free for undocumented immigrants as well. Do you?",Moderator,male,2,2,340
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,I don't. I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they've been living in the shadows.,Candidate,female,2,2,341
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"And instead of putting a band-aid on this problem, fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenships, that they are no longer treated as second-class citizens in this country. We've got to look at the challenge that people all across the country are facing, under crushing student debt.",Candidate,female,2,2,342
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it. This is about promise for our future and we've got to make those kinds of investments.",Candidate,female,2,2,343
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Congresswoman. Mayor de Blasio, what's your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,344
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Yes, I -- I agree with the congress member but I don't hear an answer from the vice president. I'm confused. I asked the vice president point blank, did he use his power to stop those deportations. He went right around the question.",Candidate,male,2,2,345
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump he's not going to let you off the hook. So did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake, we shouldn't do it. Which one?",Candidate,male,2,2,346
Joe Biden,NA,I was vice president. I am not the president. I keep my recommendation to him in private. Unlike you I can expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him. That is not what I do.,Candidate,male,2,2,347
Joe Biden,NA,What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system. That's what he did. That's who did. But much more has to be done. Much more has to be done.,Candidate,male,2,2,348
Bill de Blasio,NA,I still don't hear an answer.,Candidate,male,2,2,349
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Booker, please respond.",Moderator,male,2,2,350
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, a couple of things. First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.",Candidate,male,2,2,351
Cory Booker,NA,"And the second thing that this really irks me because I heard the vice president say that if you got a PhD., you can come right into this country. Well that's playing into what the republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.",Candidate,male,2,2,352
Cory Booker,NA,From are from shithole countries and some are from worthy countries. We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors for everyone.,Candidate,male,2,2,353
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,354
Cory Booker,NA,Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.,Candidate,male,2,2,355
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator, thank you. Mr. Vice President, your response.",Moderator,male,2,2,356
Joe Biden,NA,The fact is that's what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants. All of us. All of us. Some here came against their will; others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives. And they did.,Candidate,male,2,2,357
Joe Biden,NA,"(Inaudible) that's what we're talking about. That's what made us great. And the fact of the matter is, I think the president of the United States, Barack Obama, went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.",Candidate,male,2,2,358
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,359
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"Again, President Trump, under his administration seven children died in his custody. In -- under his administration families have been torn apart. This party is talking about real ideas for the future. We're talking about what we will do to change America.",Candidate,female,2,2,360
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"But we must not forget about our values. We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated. We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us. Let's remind the American people who we are, why we are democrats, and why we're running for president.",Candidate,female,2,2,361

Jake Tapper,NA,"I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mr. Vice President, Senator Booker called your new criminal justice reform plan, quote, ""an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country,"" unquote. Why is Senator Booker wrong?",Moderator,male,2,2,365
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, I don't -- I think he is wrong. I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.",Candidate,male,2,2,366
Joe Biden,NA,"Right now, we're in a situation where, when someone is convicted of a drug crime, they end up going to jail and to prison. They should be going to rehabilitation. They shouldn't be going to prison. When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.",Candidate,male,2,2,367
Joe Biden,NA,"And when they get out of prison, they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had before, including Pell grants for education, including making sure that they're able to have housing, public housing, including they have all the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.",Candidate,male,2,2,368
Joe Biden,NA,"That's the essence of what my plan, in detail, lays out. I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator would want to. And so I -- you know, I look -- anyway, that's what I think my plan -- I know what my plan does, and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.",Candidate,male,2,2,369
Jake Tapper,NA,"Senator Booker, your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,370

Joe Biden,NA,"In 2007 you became mayor and you had a police department that was -- you went out and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy; you -- and engaged in stop-and-frisk. You had 75 percent of those stops reviewed as illegal. You found yourself in a situation where three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up. The Justice Department came after you for saying you were -- you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor.",Candidate,male,2,2,385

Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden?",Moderator,male,2,2,394

Joe Biden,NA,"And the fact of the matter is, secondly, there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor, there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt. Why did you announce on the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in 2007, when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine disparity?",Candidate,male,2,2,396
Cory Booker,NA,"Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community, you're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor.

He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street.",Candidate,male,2,2,420

Bill de Blasio,NA,"You know why? Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution. And years went by, and a lot of the pain accrued.",Candidate,male,2,2,424
Bill de Blasio,NA,"And in the meantime, what I'm working on is making sure -- and I have for five years -- there will never be another tragedy, there will never be another Eric Garner, because we're changing fundamentally how we police.",Candidate,male,2,2,425

Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, we, in fact, insisted that we change the rules that police engage in. They had to have -- we provided for body cameras. We made sure -- there were a lot of things that were changed in the process, but 38,000 people in the federal system were released under the system.",Candidate,male,2,2,431
Joe Biden,NA,"And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done. But here's the deal. The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago. And now, all of a sudden, you know -- I find it fascinating. Everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties, and he chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made.

Andrew Yang,NA,"I want to share a story that a prison guard, a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me. He said, we should pay people to stay out of jail, because we spend so much when they're behind bars. Right now, we think we're saving money, we just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways. We should put money directly into people's hands, certainly when they come out of prison, but before they go into prison.",Candidate,male,2,2,440

Jake Tapper,NA,I want to bring in Senator Gillibrand. You heard earlier Mayor de Blasio respond to Secretary Castro on the question of why the police officer who killed Eric Garner is still on the NYPD. Was that response adequate? Please respond.,Moderator,male,2,2,443
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,No. He should be fired. He should be fired now.,Candidate,female,2,2,444
Kirsten Gillibrand,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,445
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"I sat -- I sat down with Eric Garner's mother. And I can tell you, when you've lost your son, when he begged for breath, when you know because you have a video, when you know he said ""I can't breathe"" so many times, over and over again, when you know he used an illegal chokehold, that person should be fired. And as -- if I was -- if I was the mayor, I would fire him.",Candidate,female,2,2,446
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"But as president, I would make sure that we had a full investigation, that the report would be made public. And if I wasn't satisfied, we would have a consent decree.",Candidate,female,2,2,447

Jake Tapper,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,2,449
Jake Tapper,NA,"Senator Harris, you have also been quite critical of Vice President Biden's policies on race, specifically on the issues of busing in the 1970s, having benefitted from busing when you were a young child. Vice President Biden says that your current position on busing, you're opposed to federally mandated busing, that that position is the same as his position. Is he right?",Moderator,male,2,2,450
Kamala Harris,NA,"That is simply false. And let's be very clear about this. When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate, working with segregationists to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle.",Candidate,female,2,2,451
Kamala Harris,NA,"And let's be clear about this. Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds.",Candidate,female,2,2,452
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,453
Kamala Harris,NA,"And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time.",Candidate,female,2,2,454
Kamala Harris,NA,"Now, I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner, because I, too, met with his mother. And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office, has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations.",Candidate,female,2,2,455

Kamala Harris,NA,"... Civil Rights Division -- this is important. The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped -- and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward.

Joe Biden,NA,"When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country, in Los Angeles and in San Francisco.",Candidate,male,2,2,464
Joe Biden,NA,"And she did not -- I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them. Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's right.",Candidate,male,2,2,465
Joe Biden,NA,And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorney's like me that you in fact have been -- the police officer did something that did not give you information of what (inaudible) your -- your client. She didn't do that. She never did it. And so what happened.,Candidate,male,2,2,466
Joe Biden,NA,"Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough. And he freed 1,000 of these people. If you doubt me, google 1,000 prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.",Candidate,male,2,2,467
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Vice President Biden. Senator Harris, your response.",Moderator,male,2,2,468
Kamala Harris,NA,"That is -- is simply not true. And as attorney general of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did.",Candidate,female,2,2,469

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today. Now Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president.,Candidate,female,2,2,478
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"But I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.",Candidate,female,2,2,479
Tulsi Gabbard,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,480
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,She blocked evidence -- she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.,Candidate,female,2,2,481

Equal is not equal.",Candidate,male,2,2,513

Michael Bennet,NA,"And let me tell you something else, Don. I believe you can draw a straight line from slavery through Jim Crow through the banking and the redlining to the mass incarceration that we were talking about on this stage a few minutes ago. But you know what other line I can draw? Eighty-eight percent of the people in our prisons dropped out of high school. Let's fix our school system and maybe we can fix the prison pipeline that we have.",Candidate,male,2,2,515

Jay Inslee,NA,"You know, I approach this question with humility because I have not experienced what many Americans have. I've never been a black teenager pulled over in a white neighborhood. I've never been a woman talked over in a meeting. I've never been an LGBTQ member subject to a slur. And so I have believed I have an added responsibility, a double responsibility, to deal with racial disparity. And we've talked on the way we do it, including ending -- ending the school to prison pipeline in my state.",Candidate,male,2,2,522
Jay Inslee,NA,"But I want to say this. And this is a common error that every single senator on this stage, as much as I respect them all -- they all have an enormous error which is going to prevent our party from making any progressive progress in the United States, and it is this.

Andrew Yang,NA,"They're even worse still. A study just came out that projected the average African-American median net worth will be zero by 2053. So you have to ask yourself, how is that possible? It's possible because we're in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our history. Artificial intelligence is coming. It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of call center workers, truck drivers -- the most common job in 29 states, including this one.",Candidate,male,2,2,532
Andrew Yang,NA,"And you know who suffers most in a natural disaster? It's people of color, people who have lower levels of capital and education and resources. So what are we going to do about it? We should just go back to the writings of Martin Luther King, who in 1967, his book ""Chaos or Community"", said ""We need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America."" That is the most effective way for us to address racial inequality in a genuine way and give every American a chance in the 21st Century economy.",Candidate,male,2,2,533

Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,539
Julian Castro,NA,"We know that, whether it's Baltimore or cities like Detroit, they have -- they're tremendously rich in history and culture and also in possibility. Here's what I would do if I'm president. Number one, I would invest in tremendous educational opportunity; invest in universal pre-K for three and four-year-olds; invest in improving K-12 education and also making higher education available to everyone through tuition-free public state universities, community colleges and job training and certification programs. I would follow-up on the work that I did at HUD. We passed the most sweeping rule to further desegregate our communities in the United States.",Candidate,male,2,2,540
Julian Castro,NA,"This Trump administration set that back. I would put that back in order. I would also invest in housing that is affordable, because folks know that the rent is going through the roof. And we need to make sure that you don't have to get out of West Baltimore, or Inner City Detroit, or the west side of San Antonio, or anywhere, if you want to reach your American dream. I want you to be able to accomplish it in your great neighborhood where you are.",Candidate,male,2,2,541

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So I don't believe that it's the responsibility of Cory and Kamala to be the only voice that takes on these issues of institutional racism, systemic racism in our country. I think as a white woman of privilege, who is a U.S. senator, running for president of the United States, it is also my responsibility to lift up those voices that aren't being listened to.",Candidate,female,2,2,543
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"And I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is, that when their son is walking down a street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot.",Candidate,female,2,2,544

That is what white privilege in America is today. And so, my responsibility's to only lift up those stories, but explain to communities across America, like I did in Youngstown, Ohio, to a young mother, that this is all of our responsibilities, and that together we can make our community stronger.",Candidate,female,2,2,546

You, though, are calling it the number one priority in your campaign. What do you know that the others don't?",Moderator,female,2,2,549
Jay Inslee,NA,"Well, I know the firsthand terrific impact of climate change on Americans across the country already.

Jay Inslee,NA,"Too little, too late is too dangerous. And we have to have a bold plan, and mine has been called the ""gold standard."" Now, we also need to embed environmental justice.

He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods",Candidate,male,2,2,562
Joe Biden,NA,"But h's the deal; in area, there's also another piece. Eighty-five percent of it is something I helped negotiate; and that is the Paris Climate Accord.

I visited a family in Iowa who -- water spewed into her home, Fran Parr, it tossed her refrigerator upend, all the furniture was broken, all the dishes were broken, and mud was everywhere. That is the impact of severe weather right now on families' lives.",Candidate,female,2,2,600
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"And so the truth is, we need a robust solution. When John F.

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Well, first of all, this is personal. If you can imagine, I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world. So for us growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue, it's a way of life. It's part of our culture. It's part of who we are.",Candidate,female,2,2,609
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This is why, as a member of Congress, long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act. That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy, invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today.",Candidate,female,2,2,610

Cory Booker,NA,"Look, the reason why is because, first of all, this problem didn't start yesterday. Science didn't become a reality yesterday. This has been going on for years. There was another president that would not join an international accord. Then it was the Kyoto accords. I was mayor then.",Candidate,male,2,2,617
Cory Booker,NA,"And I stood up in national leadership joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue. It must be the issue and the lens with which we view every issue. Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords. That is kindergarten. We have to go to far advances and make sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat.",Candidate,male,2,2,618

Bill de Blasio,NA,"We have a huge problem, and it's decades old in New York. But here's what we've done about it. We've declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and all as the goal of our administration, and we're doing something about it.",Candidate,male,2,2,625
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Lead poisoning has gone down 90 percent since 2005, and we're going to literally bring it down to zero, because we're going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all, and that needs to be done all over this country.",Candidate,male,2,2,626
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing. For decades they've been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility. That's part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with.",Candidate,male,2,2,627
Bill de Blasio,NA,"But I'll tell you what you do when you're actually in charge of something. I'm in charge of the largest city in this nation. You do not accept the status quo. You fix it. And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe, and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all.

Julian Castro,NA,"And then we didn't stop there. We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children. A lot of Americans don't know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it. We can do it.

Andrew Yang,NA,"Well, I'm building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and conservatives, as well as democrats and progressives. I believe I'm the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump and as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind.",Candidate,male,2,2,653

Jake Tapper,NA,We're back with the CNN Democratic presidential debate. We want to turn now to the economy.,Moderator,male,2,2,683
Jake Tapper,NA,"Secretary Castro, this is for you. Wage growth is up. Stocks are rising. Unemployment is near historic lows, including for Latinos and African-Americans. You have all outlined plans, but you in particular, that could end up raising taxes. How can you guarantee that won't hurt the economy?",Moderator,male,2,2,684
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting. Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they're getting laid off by General Motors, or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States, or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent.",Candidate,male,2,2,685
Julian Castro,NA,"So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit, like he did this. We have now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history.",Candidate,male,2,2,686

Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Secretary Castro.",Moderator,female,2,2,690
Dana Bash,NA,I want to turn now to a question about trade and for Congresswoman Gabbard. Many saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership issue as something that would be a critical tool to deal with the rise of China. You were against it. How would you ensure that the United States is able to remain competitive against China on the world stage?,Moderator,female,2,2,691
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"By pushing for fair trade, not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that give away American jobs, and that threaten our environment. These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.",Candidate,female,2,2,692
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law. This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country.",Candidate,female,2,2,693
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment. These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.,Candidate,female,2,2,694
Tulsi Gabbard,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,695
Dana Bash,NA,"So to be clear, Congresswoman, would you keep President Trump's tariffs on China in place?",Moderator,female,2,2,696
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan, and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.",Candidate,female,2,2,697
Dana Bash,NA,"Vice President Biden, would you rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, of course, President Trump withdrew from? Please respond.",Moderator,female,2,2,698
Joe Biden,NA,"I'd renegotiate. We make up 25 percent of the world's economy. In order -- either China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are. We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us, and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there.",Candidate,male,2,2,699
Joe Biden,NA,"And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now, in the things that make them more competitive. That's what we have to do. Otherwise, they are going to write the rules of the road. We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them in check from abusing.",Candidate,male,2,2,700
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you. Thank you. Vice President Biden, just to be clear, would you or would you not rejoin the TPP, yes or no?",Moderator,female,2,2,701
Joe Biden,NA,"I would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America, so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted. Otherwise, they're going to do exactly what they're doing, fill the vacuum and run the -- and run the table.",Candidate,male,2,2,702
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, sir. Mayor de Blasio, you also oppose the deal. Please respond.",Moderator,female,2,2,703
Bill de Blasio,NA,"Yeah, and I just want to ask this question of all the candidates, but particularly of Vice President Biden. President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2.0. He's got a new name for it. It's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA. It's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan. And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA.",Candidate,male,2,2,704
Bill de Blasio,NA,"So, Vice President, I believe you're the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA. Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA and that what you will believe in, which is a lot of us hope for, is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again, not just multinational corporations.",Candidate,male,2,2,705

Joe Biden,NA,"Well, I tell you what, I hope you're part of it.",Candidate,male,2,2,719
Dana Bash,NA,"OK, I'm going to ask a question of Senator Bennet now. Senator, CNN reached out to Michigan Democratic primary voters for their most pressing question. Farris from Flint, Michigan, has this question: ""Here in Detroit, our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security. How would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy?",Moderator,female,2,2,720
Michael Bennet,NA,"Dana, this goes to the last question you asked, as well, which is, how are we going to remain competitive? It's not just about trade, which we were talking about earlier. It's about whether we're going to invest in this country anymore.",Candidate,male,2,2,721
Michael Bennet,NA,"Since 2001, we have cut $5 trillion worth of taxes. Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America. We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government. We've spent $5.6 trillion in the Middle East. That's $12 trillion or $13 trillion that from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan, or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire. We've got to stop doing that.",Candidate,male,2,2,722
Michael Bennet,NA,"And we need to invest in America again. For the money that we've spent that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country. We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed. We could have fixed not just Flint, but every water system in this country.",Candidate,male,2,2,723
Dana Bash,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,2,2,724
Michael Bennet,NA,We could have made Social Security solvent for my children.,Candidate,male,2,2,725
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,2,2,726

Dana Bash,NA,"Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang, women on average earn 80 cents, about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. Senator Harris wants to fine companies that don't close their gender pay gaps. As an entrepreneur, do you think a stiff fine will change how companies pay their female employees?",Moderator,female,2,2,731
Andrew Yang,NA,"I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in start-ups and entrepreneurship. We have to do more at every step. And if you're a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home, but then when you seek a mentor or an investor, often they don't look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one.",Candidate,male,2,2,732
Andrew Yang,NA,"In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitive and abusive jobs and relationships around the country. I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is.",Candidate,male,2,2,733

Kamala Harris,NA,"I think that's support of my proposal, which is this. Since 1963, when we passed the Equal Pay Act, we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work. Fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American woman 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.",Candidate,female,2,2,739
Kamala Harris,NA,"I'm done with the conversation. So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work. Two, they will be fined for every 1 percent differential between what they're paying men and women, they will be fined 1 percent of their previous year's profit.

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So under Vice President Biden's analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family, because I had access to quality affordable day care? I just want to know what he meant when he said that.",Candidate,female,2,2,747
Joe Biden,NA,"That was a long time ago, and here's what it was about. It would have given people making today $100,000 a year a tax break for childcare. I did not want that. I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100,000. And that's what it was about.",Candidate,male,2,2,748
Joe Biden,NA,"As a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it cost.",Candidate,male,2,2,749
Joe Biden,NA,"I support making sure that every single solitary person needing childcare get an $8,000 tax credit now. That would put 700,000 women back to work, increase the GDP by almost 8/10 of 1 percent. It's the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things, why can't we do it this way?",Candidate,male,2,2,750
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"But Mr. Vice President, you didn't answer my question. What did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home it's resulting in quote, the deterioration of family ...",Candidate,female,2,2,751
Joe Biden,NA,"No, what I ...",Candidate,male,2,2,752
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,And that we are voiding -- these are quotes. It was the title of the op-ed and that just causes concern for me because we know America's women are working. 4 out of 10 moms have to work. They're the primary or sole wagers. They actually have to put food on the table.,Candidate,female,2,2,753
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,8 out of 10 moms are working today. Most women have to work to provide for their kids. Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.,Candidate,female,2,2,754
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Let the vice president respond now, thank you.",Moderator,female,2,2,755
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,So either you don't believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then?,Candidate,female,2,2,756
Joe Biden,NA,The very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children. My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children. The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don't know what's happened.,Candidate,male,2,2,757
Joe Biden,NA,I wrote the Violence against Women Act. Lilly Ledbetter. I was deeply involved in making sure the equal pay amendments. I was deeply involved on all these things. I came up with the it's on us proposal to see to it that women were treated more decently on college campuses.,Candidate,male,2,2,758
Joe Biden,NA,You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful. I'm passionate about the concern making sure women are treated equally. I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president.,Candidate,male,2,2,759
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,760
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So I understand -- Mr. Vice President -- Mr. Vice President, I respect you deeply. I respect you deeply but those words are very specific. You said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family.",Candidate,female,2,2,761
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,My grandmother worked outside the home. My -- my mother worked outside the home. And -- and ....,Candidate,female,2,2,762
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator GILLIBRAND.",Moderator,female,2,2,763
Dana Bash,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,female,2,2,764
Dana Bash,NA,I want to bring Senator Harris into this conversation.,Moderator,female,2,2,765
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,Either he no longer believes it -- I mean I just think he needs to ...,Candidate,female,2,2,766
Joe Biden,NA,I never believed it.,Candidate,male,2,2,767
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you. Senator Harris, please respond.",Moderator,female,2,2,768
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, I just -- listen, I mean talk about now running for president, you change your position on the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you mad a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest.",Candidate,female,2,2,769
Kamala Harris,NA,"Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that? Because you have only, since you've been running for president this time, said that you had -- you in some way would take that back or you didn't agree with the decision that you made over many, many years.",Candidate,female,2,2,770
Kamala Harris,NA,"And this directly impacted so many women in our country and I personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases; and the experience that those women have, those children have and that they would then be denied the resources ...",Candidate,female,2,2,771
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Let the Vice President ...",Moderator,female,2,2,772
Kamala Harris,NA,I think is -- is unacceptable.,Candidate,female,2,2,773
Joe Biden,NA,The fact is that the senator knows that that's not position. Everybody on this stage has been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point.,Candidate,male,2,2,774
Joe Biden,NA,"The Hyde Amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately. But once I wrote the legislation, making sure that every single woman would in fact be have an opportunity to have healthcare paid for by the federal government, everyone that -- that could no longer stand.",Candidate,male,2,2,775
Joe Biden,NA,"I support a woman's right to choose. I support it's a constitutional right. I've supported it and I will continue to support it and I will, in fact, move as president to see to it that the Congress legislates that that is the laws as well.",Candidate,male,2,2,776
Dana Bash,NA,"Thank you -- thank you, Mr. Vice President. Governor Inslee, your response.",Moderator,female,2,2,777
Dana Bash,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,female,2,2,778
Kamala Harris,NA,Well why did it take you so long to change your position in the Hyde Amendment. Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde?,Candidate,female,2,2,779
Joe Biden,NA,Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.,Candidate,male,2,2,780
Dana Bash,NA,"OK. Thank you. Governor Inslee, your response?",Moderator,female,2,2,781
Jay Inslee,NA,"I -- I would suggest we need to broaden our discussion. I would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in America, which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority, they have been almost always under paid.",Candidate,male,2,2,782
Jay Inslee,NA,"And that is why this year I'm proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the United States. And I believe that that is long, long overdue. I think it is true for nursing staff as well. And I'm glad that we've now passed in measures. And I'm glad that we've increased our union membership 10 percent ...",Candidate,male,2,2,783
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Governor.",Moderator,male,2,2,784
Jay Inslee,NA,So unions can stand up for women as well.,Candidate,male,2,2,785
Jay Inslee,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,786
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you, Governor Inslee. I want to turn to foreign policy, if we can. Senator Booker, there are about 14,000 U.S. services members in Afghanistan right now. If elected, will they still be in Afghanistan by the end of your first year in office?",Moderator,male,2,2,787
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time. A guy that literally tweets out that we're pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan.",Candidate,male,2,2,788
Cory Booker,NA,"And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible, but I will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline. I will make sure we do it, we do it expeditiously, we do it safely, to not create a vacuum that's ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and perhaps create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.",Candidate,male,2,2,789
Jake Tapper,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only veteran on this stage. Please respond.",Moderator,male,2,2,790
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This is real in a way that's very difficult to convey in words. I was deployed to Iraq in 2005 during the height of the war where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war. Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.",Candidate,female,2,2,791
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now. Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan, 14,000 servicemembers are deployed there. This is not about arbitrary deadlines. This is about leadership, the leadership I will bring to do the right thing to bring our troops home, within the first year in office, because they shouldn't have been there this long.",Candidate,female,2,2,792
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"For too long, we've had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our servicemembers, on their families. We have to do the right thing, end these wasteful regime change wars, and bring our troops home.",Candidate,female,2,2,793
Tulsi Gabbard,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,794
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman.",Moderator,male,2,2,795
Jake Tapper,NA,"Mr. Yang, Iran has now breached the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, and that puts Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon, the ability to do so, at the very least. You've said if Iran violates the agreement, the U.S. would need to respond, quote, ""very strongly."" So how would a President Yang respond right now?",Moderator,male,2,2,796
Andrew Yang,NA,"I would move to de-escalate tensions in Iran, because they're responding to the fact that we pulled out of this agreement. And it wasn't just us and Iran. There were many other world powers that were part of that multinational agreement. We'd have to try and reenter that agreement, renegotiate the timelines, because the timelines now don't make as much sense.",Candidate,male,2,2,797
Andrew Yang,NA,"But I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars. Right now, our strength abroad reflects our strength at home. What's happened, really? We've fallen apart at home, so we elected Donald Trump, and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies.",Candidate,male,2,2,798
Andrew Yang,NA,"What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problems right here at home. We've spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that have had unclear benefits. We've been in a constant state of war for 18 years. This is not what the American people want. I would bring the troops home, I would de-escalate tensions with Iran, and I would start investing our resources in our own communities.",Candidate,male,2,2,799
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,800
Jake Tapper,NA,"Governor Inslee, your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,801
Jay Inslee,NA,"Well, I think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment. And there is no sort of primer for presidents to read. We have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions.",Candidate,male,2,2,802
Jay Inslee,NA,"I was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the Iraq war. I was a relatively new member of Congress, and I made the right judgment, because it was obvious to me that George Bush was fanning the flames of war.",Candidate,male,2,2,803
Jay Inslee,NA,"Now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president who would be willing to beat the drums of war. We need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions. That was the right vote, and I believe it.",Candidate,male,2,2,804
Jake Tapper,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Vice President Biden, he was obviously suggesting that you made the wrong decision and had bad judgment when you voted to go to war in Iraq as a U.S. senator.",Moderator,male,2,2,805
Joe Biden,NA,"I did make a bad judgment, trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in. From the moment ""shock and awe"" started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort, and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration.",Candidate,male,2,2,806
Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq, he turned and said, Joe, get our combat troops out, in front of the entire national security team. One of the proudest moment of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that we're coming -- all our combat troops are coming home.",Candidate,male,2,2,807
Jake Tapper,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,2,2,808
Joe Biden,NA,"I opposed the surge in Afghanistan, this long overdue -- we should have not, in fact, gone into Afghanistan the way...",Candidate,male,2,2,809

Jay Inslee,NA,Mr. Vice President -- I'd like to comment.,Candidate,male,2,2,812
Jake Tapper,NA,"I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq, Governor -- I'm sorry, Congresswoman Gabbard. Your response to what Vice President Biden just said.",Moderator,male,2,2,813
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"We were all lied to. This is the betrayal. This is the betrayal to the American people, to me, to my fellow servicemembers. We were all lied to, told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was working with Al Qaida, and that this posed a threat to the American people.",Candidate,female,2,2,814
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country, to go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans.",Candidate,female,2,2,815
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us. We were supposed to be going after Al Qaida. But over years now, not only have we not gone after Al Qaida, who is stronger today than they were in 9/11, our president is supporting Al Qaida.",Candidate,female,2,2,816
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Congresswoman.",Moderator,male,2,2,817

Bill de Blasio,NA,We didn't talk about Iran.,Candidate,male,2,2,820
Don Lemon,NA,Please.,Moderator,male,2,2,821
Bill de Blasio,NA,"We're on the march to war in Iran right now, and we blew by it.",Candidate,male,2,2,822
Don Lemon,NA,"Please, Mayor. The rules -- please follow the rules.",Moderator,male,2,2,823
Bill de Blasio,NA,"I respect the rules, but we have to stop this march to war in Iran.",Candidate,male,2,2,824
Don Lemon,NA,"Mayor, thank you very much. We're going on...",Moderator,male,2,2,825
Bill de Blasio,NA,And the Democratic Party has to stand up for it.,Candidate,male,2,2,826
Don Lemon,NA,"... and we're going to talk about another subject. Mayor, thank you very much. I appreciate that.",Moderator,male,2,2,827
Don Lemon,NA,"Let's talk about now the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appearance in front of Congress last week. When asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office, his answer was yes.",Moderator,male,2,2,828
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Harris, you have criticized President Trump for interfering with the Justice Department, and just last month you said if you were elected president, your Justice Department would, quote, ""have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against former President Trump."" Why is it OK for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody, but President Trump, not him?",Moderator,male,2,2,829
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do. But, listen, look, we all watched his testimony. I've read the report. There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president, and he needs to be held accountable. I have seen people go to prison for far less.",Candidate,female,2,2,830
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,831
Kamala Harris,NA,"And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the president of the United States.",Candidate,female,2,2,832
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,833
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Booker, your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,834
Cory Booker,NA,My response is exactly that. I've read the report. I've read the redacted versions of the report. We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of the America. We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world. He's acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold.,Candidate,male,2,2,835
Cory Booker,NA,And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage. I believe that we in the United States Congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately. And I'll tell you this...,Candidate,male,2,2,836
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,837
Cory Booker,NA,"Debbie Stabenow now has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings, because he is now stonewalling Congress, not allowing -- subjecting himself to the checks and balances. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. The politics of this be dammed. When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is, is what will we have done? And I believe the Congress should do its job.",Candidate,male,2,2,838
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Booker, thank you very much. Secretary Castro, what's your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,839
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, I agree. I was the first of the candidates to call on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are 10 different incidents that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings.",Candidate,male,2,2,840
Julian Castro,NA,"As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute. However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far, that you're likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,2,2,841
Don Lemon,NA,"Thank you, Secretary.",Moderator,male,2,2,842
Don Lemon,NA,"Mayor de Blasio, I'm going to bring you in. What's your response?",Moderator,male,2,2,843
Bill de Blasio,NA,"I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment. But I want to caution my fellow Democrats. While we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.",Candidate,male,2,2,844
Bill de Blasio,NA,"We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready -- and I ask people on this stage this question -- are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? That's something every American wants to know about. That's something they want answers to right now.",Candidate,male,2,2,845
Bill de Blasio,NA,"So, yeah, move for impeachment, but don't forget to do the people's business and to stand up for working people, because that's how we're actually going to beat Donald Trump. The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.",Candidate,male,2,2,846
Bill de Blasio,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,847
Don Lemon,NA,"Mayor, thank you very much. Senator Bennet, how do you respond to this conversation?",Moderator,male,2,2,848
Michael Bennet,NA,"I think, look, as we go forward here, we need to recognize a very practical reality, which is that we are four months -- we've got the August recess. Then we are four months away from the Iowa Caucuses. And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress.",Candidate,male,2,2,849
Michael Bennet,NA,I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump.,Candidate,male,2,2,850
Michael Bennet,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,851
Michael Bennet,NA,He has to be a single-term president. And we can't do anything that plays into our -- his hands. We were talking earlier about -- about climate up here. It's so important. Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that's ever in the White House.,Candidate,male,2,2,852
Don Lemon,NA,"Senator Bennet, thank you very much. Secretary Castro, please respond.",Moderator,male,2,2,853
Michael Bennet,NA,But we need to be smart about how we're running or we're going to give him a second term. We can't do it.,Candidate,male,2,2,854
Don Lemon,NA,"Secretary, please, your turn.",Moderator,male,2,2,855
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we're articulating to the American people. We're going to continue to do that. We have an election coming up.",Candidate,male,2,2,856
Julian Castro,NA,"At the same time, Senator, you know, I think that too many folks in the Senate and in the Congress have been spooked by 1998. I believe that the times are different. And in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it.",Candidate,male,2,2,857
Julian Castro,NA,"And what's going to happen in the fall of next year, of 2020, if they don't impeach him, is he's going to say, ""You see? You see? The Democrats didn't go after me on impeachment, and you know why? Because I didn't do anything wrong.""",Candidate,male,2,2,858
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,859

Don Lemon,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,2,2,866
Michael Bennet,NA,I -- I don't disagree with that. You just said it better than I did. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time. It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that. And I'm glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition...,Candidate,male,2,2,867
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, my brother can. He's here tonight.",Candidate,male,2,2,868

Bill de Blasio,NA,"Thank you. For the last three years, we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant. And why? So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else.",Candidate,male,2,2,877
Bill de Blasio,NA,"We can't let them get away with it. If we're going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something. This has to be the party of labor unions. This has to be the party of universal healthcare. This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.",Candidate,male,2,2,878
Bill de Blasio,NA,"And when we do that, Donald Trump right on cue will call us socialists. Well, here's what I'll say to him. Donald, you're the real socialist. The problem is, it's socialism for the rich. We, here in this country, we don't have to take that anymore. We can fight back.",Candidate,male,2,2,879

We have faced challenges that we've -- we actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought, how hard they worked, how hard they organized, the votes they had to take, the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free.",Candidate,male,2,2,883
Michael Bennet,NA,"And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history, who doesn't believe in the rule of law, who doesn't believe in the independence of the judiciary, who doesn't believe that climate change is real.",Candidate,male,2,2,884
Michael Bennet,NA,"I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us, all of us, to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them, and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face, but the only way we're going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us.",Candidate,male,2,2,885
Michael Bennet,NA,"We need to come together united against a broken Washington, make Donald Trump a one-term president, and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves. We have to do it for them.",Candidate,male,2,2,886

Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"I'm running for president because I want to help people, and I actually have the experience and the ability to do that. I've brought Congress together and actually made a difference in people's lives.",Candidate,female,2,2,898
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"I also know how to beat Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to the American people. I've taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan and Ohio and in Pennsylvania, and I'll go to all the places in this country. I will fight for your family. It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you live, it doesn't matter who you love. Because that's my responsibility.",Candidate,female,2,2,899
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"And I've done this before. I started out in a 2-to-1 Republican district. I won it twice. I've never lost an election since. And I not only bring people together electorally, but also legislatively. I get things done.",Candidate,female,2,2,900
Kirsten Gillibrand,NA,"So we need a president who's not afraid of the big challenges, of the big fights. There is no false choice. We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas or we don't need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters. You need someone who can do both. And that's who I am.",Candidate,female,2,2,901

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Now, Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us. They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia and China and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.",Candidate,female,2,2,906
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Now, as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, we would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit. And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say, ""Incoming missile. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.""",Candidate,female,2,2,907
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmonger's hoax. There is no shelter. It's all a lie.",Candidate,female,2,2,908
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"As president, I will end this insanity, because it doesn't have to be this way. I will end these wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to de-escalate these tensions and take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home, things like health care for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure.",Candidate,female,2,2,909

Julian Castro,NA,"Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty. And I'm not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion. I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation, with one destiny.",Candidate,male,2,2,915
Julian Castro,NA,"Our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on Earth.",Candidate,male,2,2,916

Jake Tapper,NA,Mr. Yang?,Moderator,male,2,2,919
Andrew Yang,NA,"You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate? It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show.",Candidate,male,2,2,920
Andrew Yang,NA,It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.,Candidate,male,2,2,921
Andrew Yang,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,922
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,923
Andrew Yang,NA,"We need to be laser-focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common jobs in America may not exist in a decade, or that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the freedom dividend, would put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult. It would be a game-changer for millions of American families.",Candidate,male,2,2,924
Andrew Yang,NA,"If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what $1,000 a month would mean to your community. I have done the math.

Cory Booker,NA,"Thank you. First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit. They're hosting us today, and one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us or underestimate or worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause.",Candidate,male,2,2,928
Cory Booker,NA,"That's the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy...",Candidate,male,2,2,929
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,2,2,930
Cory Booker,NA,"... that was a UAW worker, my grandfather, who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in this city.",Candidate,male,2,2,931
Cory Booker,NA,"That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that. But the dream of this country is under threat right now. While, my mom's generation, 80 -- 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. It's now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,2,2,932
Cory Booker,NA,"I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling. The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him. He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room. It's when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before. It's what's going to save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States, not just uniting the Democratic Party but making sure that we put more ""indivisible"" back into this one nation under God.",Candidate,male,2,2,933

Kamala Harris,NA,"So in my background as attorney general of California, I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners, many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another. I've taken on the for-profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children.",Candidate,female,2,2,937
Kamala Harris,NA,"And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House.",Candidate,female,2,2,938
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,2,2,939
Kamala Harris,NA,"And I'm going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this. By their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards.",Candidate,female,2,2,940
Kamala Harris,NA,"What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years. And let me tell you, we've got a long rap sheet. We're looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families. We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents. We have someone who passed a so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families.",Candidate,female,2,2,941
Kamala Harris,NA,"So we must defeat him and then, in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country. And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at 3:00 in the morning. And that is my agenda, the 3:00 a.m. agenda that is focused on giving folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the health care they need and the future they deserve.",Candidate,female,2,2,942

Joe Biden,NA,"Look, I've said it many times, and I think everyone agrees with this. We're in a battle for the soul of America. This is the most consequential election anyone of you, no matter how old or young you are, has ever, ever participated in. Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration -- hard to overcome the damage he's done, but we can overcome it. Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way. The America we know will no longer exist.",Candidate,male,2,2,947
Joe Biden,NA,"Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let him know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. And we choose -- we choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything. This is the United States of America. When we've acted together, we have never, never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was.",Candidate,male,2,2,948

Dana Bash,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,3,1,1
Dana Bash,NA,"There will be life after Donald Trump. But the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump, and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision: universal pre-K and universal health care, unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy, a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.",Moderator,female,3,1,2
Dana Bash,NA,"But first, we have to win. And that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. That's what Kennedy did, it's what Carter did, it's what Clinton did, it's what Barack Obama did, and it's what I can do in this race. Get back Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, and finally turn Texas blue and say goodbye to Donald Trump.",Moderator,female,3,1,3

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So, you're going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great. But if you see that some of them seem a little off-track, I've got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me, because I don't want to be the president for half of America.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"On Aug. 3, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country. The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is, the cost and the consequence of his presidency.",Candidate,male,3,1,15
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our president.",Candidate,male,3,1,16
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills, we have to be bigger. We have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That's what I want to do for you as president of the United States. Thank you.",Candidate,male,3,1,17

Cory Booker,NA,"But it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Ms. Virginia Jones, who challenged me. She said, ""Boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that's all there's ever going to be. But if you're stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change."" She was a church woman that said, ""Without vision, the people will perish.""",Candidate,male,3,1,21
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, that's exactly what we did. We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people think - thought was impossible.",Candidate,male,3,1,22
Cory Booker,NA,"That's the story of America. At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose. The differences among us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. That's why I'm running for president, and that's how I will lead this nation.",Candidate,male,3,1,23

Andrew Yang,NA,"In America today, everything revolves around the almighty dollar - our schools, our hospitals, our media, even our government. It's why we don't trust our institutions anymore. We have to get our country working for us again, instead of the other way around. We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine.",Candidate,male,3,1,26
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,27

Andrew Yang,NA,"That's why I'm going to do something unprecedented tonight. My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now. If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we've ever seen. As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know what's at stake in our national leadership.",Candidate,male,3,1,33
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We keep sending politicians to Washington asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us. Good politics is supposed to be not about the day-to-day fights of the politicians, but about the day-to-day lives of Americans.",Candidate,male,3,1,34
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We just marked the anniversary of 9/11. All day today, I've been thinking about Sept. 12, the way it felt when for a moment we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people. That's what presidential leadership can do. That's what the presidency is for. And that is why I'm asking for your vote.",Candidate,male,3,1,35

Kamala Harris,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,40
Kamala Harris,NA,"So, President Trump, you've spent the last two-and-a-half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we've gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.",Candidate,female,3,1,41
Kamala Harris,NA,"But here's what you don't get: What you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this. And we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we're registered to vote. And I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America.",Candidate,female,3,1,42

Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,47
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But we must do more. We must do more.

And as president, I am prepared to take them on.",Candidate,male,3,1,48
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has health care as a human right, not a privilege.

Joe Biden,NA,"You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said, we're doing it because we refuse to postpone. Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases which, if we invest in them, we can find cures.",Candidate,male,3,1,63
Joe Biden,NA,"I refuse to postpone giving single child in America, no matter their Zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change.",Candidate,male,3,1,64

We're walking around with our heads down like woe is me. We're the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,3,1,65
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,66
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Candidates, thank you. Several of you said you are more united than divided, and that is certainly true. All of you agree on one big thing, the goal of defeating President Trump, driving the country in a new direction. But out on the campaign trail, you have outlined big differences over how far to go and how fast to go.",Moderator,male,3,1,67
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"And, Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate. Both senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare-for-all. You want to build on Obamacare, not scrap it. They propose spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt. And they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs.",Moderator,male,3,1,68
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Are Sens. Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go and where the country needs to go?,Moderator,male,3,1,69
Joe Biden,NA,"That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I think - I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.",Candidate,male,3,1,70
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion, $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. That's before - exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear that tonight how that's happened.",Candidate,male,3,1,71
Joe Biden,NA,"Thus far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. And the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. There's a lot of other things that need to be done.",Candidate,male,3,1,72
Joe Biden,NA,"I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at-risk schools that are Title I schools, from 15 to $45 billion a year. But I go down the line and these are things we're talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it's better.",Candidate,male,3,1,73
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Sen. Warren, let me take that to you, particularly on what Sen. Biden was saying there about health care. He has actually praised Bernie Sanders for being candid about his health care plan, that senator - says that Sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated. Will you make that same admission?",Moderator,male,3,1,74
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, let's be clear about health care. And let's actually start where vice president did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being.",Candidate,female,3,1,75
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,76
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And now the question is, how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle-class families are going to pay less. That's how this is going to work.",Candidate,female,3,1,77
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,78
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Direct question. You said middle-class families are going to pay less. But will middle-class taxes go up to pay for the program? I know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down. Will middle-class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?,Moderator,male,3,1,79
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost. That's what they have to deal with. And understand, families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, ""Sorry, you can't see that specialist."" Every time an insurance company says, ""Sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription.",Candidate,female,3,1,80
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it. They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the co-pay. What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets, what's going to happen in their budgets.",Candidate,female,3,1,81
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And the answer is on Medicare-for-all, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under Medicare-for-all in our health care system.",Candidate,female,3,1,82
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,83
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Sen. Sanders, you were invoked by the vice president, also take on that question about taxes.",Moderator,male,3,1,84
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, Joe said that Medicare-for-all would cost over $30 trillion.",Candidate,male,3,1,85
Bernie Sanders,NA,"That's right, Joe.",Candidate,male,3,1,86
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare-for-all is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so...",Candidate,male,3,1,87
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,88
Bernie Sanders,NA,"... intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we're going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.",Candidate,male,3,1,89
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,90
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We need - we need a health-care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies.",Candidate,male,3,1,91
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health-care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare-for-all is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.",Candidate,male,3,1,92
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,93
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Vice president Biden...,Moderator,male,3,1,94
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"If I could respond, George.",Candidate,female,3,1,95
George Stephanopoulos,NA,You get a response and then we're going to broaden out the discussion.,Moderator,male,3,1,96
Joe Biden,NA,"Okay, number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the costs of - the largest out-of-pocket payment you'll pay is $1,000. You'll be able to get into a - anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, et cetera.",Candidate,male,3,1,97
Joe Biden,NA,"But guess what? Of the 160 million people who like their health care now, they can keep it. If they don't like it, they can leave. Number one.",Candidate,male,3,1,98
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, the fact of the matter is, we're in a situation where, if you notice, he hasn't answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Let's have a big idea. The tax of 2 percent that the senator is talking about, that raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you $28 billion short.",Candidate,male,3,1,99
Joe Biden,NA,"The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your pay - there will be a deductible, in your paycheck. You're going to - the middle class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more. They're going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income tax. That's a reality. Now, it's not a bad idea if you like it. I don't like it.",Candidate,male,3,1,100
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Okay, now I want everybody to keep to the time, but you did invoke both senators. I have to get responses from them...",Moderator,male,3,1,101
Joe Biden,NA,"Sure, no, that's good.",Candidate,male,3,1,102
George Stephanopoulos,NA,... and then we will broaden it out.,Moderator,male,3,1,103
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Warren, you go first.",Moderator,male,3,1,104
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, let's be clear, I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.",Candidate,female,3,1,105
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,106
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I've met people who like their doctors. I've met people who like their nurses. I've met people who like their pharmacists. I've met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care. And we just need to be clear about what Medicare-for-all is all about.,Candidate,female,3,1,107
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we're going to do this by saying, everyone is covered by Medicare-for-all, every health care provider is covered. And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill?",Candidate,female,3,1,108
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Sanders.,Moderator,male,3,1,109
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.",Candidate,male,3,1,110
Joe Biden,NA,This is America.,Candidate,male,3,1,111
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Yes, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries. And they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare-for-all proposal, when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums, maybe you've run into people who love their premiums, I haven't.",Candidate,male,3,1,112
Bernie Sanders,NA,"What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare-for-all will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.",Candidate,male,3,1,113
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you said in your opening statement you don't - you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes. Who represents the extreme on this stage?",Moderator,male,3,1,114
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals up here, George, so I'm talking about...",Candidate,female,3,1,115
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Which ones?,Moderator,male,3,1,116
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"If I could - if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends. First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada.",Candidate,female,3,1,117
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We have worked to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that's a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figure that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.",Candidate,female,3,1,118
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor's creed, which is, do no harm. And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. And on page eight - on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.",Candidate,female,3,1,119
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That's in four years. I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea. And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning. And that is a public option. A non-profit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea.",Candidate,female,3,1,120
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,121
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Warren, page eight of the bill, she says, 149 people will lose their health insurance.",Moderator,male,3,1,122
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I'm sorry.,Candidate,female,3,1,123
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"She said, page eight of the bill, 149 million people will lose their health insurance.",Moderator,male,3,1,124
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Current health insurance.,Candidate,female,3,1,125
Joe Biden,NA,One hundred forty-nine million.,Candidate,male,3,1,126
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Million, excuse me.",Moderator,male,3,1,127
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles.",Candidate,female,3,1,128
Elizabeth Warren,NA,What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.,Candidate,female,3,1,129
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,male,3,1,130
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway.",Candidate,male,3,1,131
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA. I propose Medicare-for-all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we're right, as progressives, that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you?",Candidate,male,3,1,132
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.",Moderator,male,3,1,133
Bernie Sanders,NA,"George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? Fifty million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare-for-all is comprehensive health care. Covers all basic needs, including home health care.",Candidate,male,3,1,134
Bernie Sanders,NA,"It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So, if you want comprehensive health care, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare-for-all is the way to go.",Candidate,male,3,1,135
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,136
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Harris, you startled out co-sponsoring Senator Sanders's bill, you now say you're uncomfortable with it. Why?",Moderator,male,3,1,137
Kamala Harris,NA,"I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.",Candidate,female,3,1,138
Kamala Harris,NA,"I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far on Medicare-for-all. I support Medicare-for-all, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did.",Candidate,female,3,1,139
Kamala Harris,NA,"Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them.",Candidate,female,3,1,140
Kamala Harris,NA,"So, under my Medicare-for-all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that's what people want. And I agree, we shouldn't take choice from people.",Candidate,female,3,1,141
Kamala Harris,NA,"But here's the thing. Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.",Candidate,female,3,1,142
Kamala Harris,NA,"So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We all fought against it. And then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o'clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country.",Candidate,female,3,1,143
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,144
Kamala Harris,NA,"Fast forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans.",Candidate,female,3,1,145
Kamala Harris,NA,"And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they're going to have health care and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let's focus on the end goal. If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.",Candidate,female,3,1,146
Joe Biden,NA,"George, 15 seconds? Fifteen seconds?",Candidate,male,3,1,147
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,148
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Let me get to Congressman O'Rourke and then bring you - go ahead, Mr. Vice President.",Moderator,male,3,1,149
Joe Biden,NA,"Fifteen seconds. Look, everybody says we want an option. The option I'm proposing is Medicare-for-all - Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance - from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don't have - no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.",Candidate,male,3,1,150
Joe Biden,NA,"And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings, the president thinks - my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer's going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They're going to give back that money to the employee?",Candidate,male,3,1,151
Bernie Sanders,NA,"As a matter of fact, they will in our bill.",Candidate,male,3,1,152
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, let me tell you something. For a socialist, you've got - for a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.",Candidate,male,3,1,153
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Sanders?,Moderator,male,3,1,154
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Okay, one minute, George?",Candidate,male,3,1,155
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Go ahead.,Moderator,male,3,1,156
Bernie Sanders,NA,"All right. Two points. You got to defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they're going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease - cancer or heart disease.",Candidate,male,3,1,157
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer. And our program is the only one that does that.",Candidate,male,3,1,158
Joe Biden,NA,"I know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something. It's personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.",Candidate,male,3,1,159
Joe Biden,NA,"And we're talking four, six, eight, ten years, depending on who you talk about, before we get to Medicare-for-all. Come on. I've been there. You've been there. You know what it's like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now.",Candidate,male,3,1,160
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,161
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Congressman O'Rourke?,Moderator,male,3,1,162
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now.",Candidate,male,3,1,163
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions uninsured and uncared for.",Candidate,male,3,1,164
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better. In my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who's insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare. And those, like members of unions who've fought for the health care plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them. This is the best possible path forward.",Candidate,male,3,1,165
Joe Biden,NA,You just described my plan.,Candidate,male,3,1,166
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"This is - health care is the top issue for everyone in the country. I want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond. So, Secretary Castro, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you will get a minute.",Moderator,male,3,1,167
Julian Castro,NA,"Thank you. And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this. And, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.",Candidate,male,3,1,168
Julian Castro,NA,"Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn't true, when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that, and they said that was true.",Candidate,male,3,1,169
Julian Castro,NA,"You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse. But that whole time, she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available.",Candidate,male,3,1,170
Julian Castro,NA,"If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do. But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn't have a buy in.",Candidate,male,3,1,171
Julian Castro,NA,"That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.",Candidate,male,3,1,172
Joe Biden,NA,They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.,Candidate,male,3,1,173
Julian Castro,NA,You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.,Candidate,male,3,1,174
Joe Biden,NA,Do not have to buy in if you can't afford it.,Candidate,male,3,1,175
Julian Castro,NA,You said they would have to buy in.,Candidate,male,3,1,176
Joe Biden,NA,"Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled.",Candidate,male,3,1,177
Julian Castro,NA,"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.",Candidate,male,3,1,178
Joe Biden,NA,I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money.,Candidate,male,3,1,179
Julian Castro,NA,"I mean, look, look, we need a health care system...",Candidate,male,3,1,180
Joe Biden,NA,She - you're automatically enrolled.,Candidate,male,3,1,181
Julian Castro,NA,"It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.",Candidate,male,3,1,182

Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,193
Andrew Yang,NA,"Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team here. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.",Candidate,male,3,1,194
Andrew Yang,NA,"And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend their contractors. It's harder to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business.",Candidate,male,3,1,195
Andrew Yang,NA,"The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.",Candidate,male,3,1,196

George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Booker...,Moderator,male,3,1,198
Andrew Yang,NA,"Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the health care system.",Candidate,male,3,1,199
Andrew Yang,NA,"And the Cleveland Clinic, where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe - shocker - they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people.",Candidate,male,3,1,200
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Booker, close out this discussion.",Moderator,male,3,1,201
Cory Booker,NA,"Thank you very much. Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis. They don't have health insurance. Their health insurance doesn't go far enough. They can't afford their prescription drugs.",Candidate,male,3,1,202
Cory Booker,NA,"Look, I'm clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare-for-all. I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system. But dear God, I know every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions.",Candidate,male,3,1,203
Cory Booker,NA,"And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now. They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now.",Candidate,male,3,1,204
Cory Booker,NA,"And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.",Candidate,male,3,1,205
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,206
Cory Booker,NA,"And we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans. But every single day, I'll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.",Candidate,male,3,1,207
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Candidates, thank you. Linsey Davis?",Moderator,male,3,1,208
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Thanks, George. Since we're here at an HBCU, I'd like to start with young black voters. Several recent polls indicate their number-one concern is racism. This campus, this state, and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on Latinos in El Paso.",Moderator,female,3,1,209
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Now, we know that the racial divide started long before President Trump and President Obama, but each of you on this stage has said that President Trump has made that divide worse.

We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that.",Candidate,male,3,1,225
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Senator Booker, you have said, quote, ""The real question isn't who is or isn't a racist. It's who is going to do something about it."" Senator, what do you plan to do about it?",Moderator,female,3,1,226
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists. The question isn't who isn't a racist. It's who is and isn't doing something about racism.",Candidate,male,3,1,227
Cory Booker,NA,"And this is not just an issue that started yesterday. It's not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system. And it's nice to go all the way back to slavery, but dear God, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850.",Candidate,male,3,1,228
Cory Booker,NA,"We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out, and having a plan to do something about it. If I am president of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes.",Candidate,male,3,1,229
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,230
Cory Booker,NA,"And we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans, from criminal justice reform to the disparities in health care to even one that we don't talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.",Candidate,male,3,1,231
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,232
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you've been struggling with issues around race in your own community. You've also said that anyone who votes to re-elect President Trump is, at best, looking the other way on racism. Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?",Moderator,female,3,1,233
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I believe what's deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a chance to change all of that.",Candidate,male,3,1,234
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us. That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It's - it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms compound. In the same way that a dollar saved compounds, so does a dollar stolen.",Candidate,male,3,1,235
Pete Buttigieg,NA,And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.,Candidate,male,3,1,236
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25 percent...",Candidate,male,3,1,237

Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,240
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We can and must do that. But that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker. Because when I - where I come from, a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three. We've got to say that...",Candidate,male,3,1,241
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,242
Pete Buttigieg,NA,... and bring people together.,Candidate,male,3,1,243
Lindsey Davis,NA,Also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform.,Moderator,female,3,1,244
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Senator Harris, you released your plan for that just this week. And it does contradict some of your prior positions. Among them, you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don't. You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don't. You've said that you changed on these and other things because you were, quote, ""swimming against the current, and thankfully the currents have changed.""",Moderator,female,3,1,245
Lindsey Davis,NA,"But when you had the power, why didn't you try to effect change then?",Moderator,female,3,1,246
Lindsey Davis,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,3,1,247
Kamala Harris,NA,"So, there have been - there have been - I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record.",Candidate,female,3,1,248
Kamala Harris,NA,"Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe. And second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias. And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that, if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside.",Candidate,female,3,1,249
Kamala Harris,NA,"And so I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs.",Candidate,female,3,1,250
Kamala Harris,NA,I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.,Candidate,female,3,1,251
Kamala Harris,NA,I created one of the first in the nation trainings for a police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.,Candidate,female,3,1,252
Kamala Harris,NA,"Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one.",Candidate,female,3,1,253
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,254
Kamala Harris,NA,"It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable.",Candidate,female,3,1,255
Kamala Harris,NA,"And finally, my plan is about making sure that, in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact.",Candidate,female,3,1,256
Kamala Harris,NA,"And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.",Candidate,female,3,1,257

Lindsey Davis,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, during your eight years as a prosecutor in Minnesota, there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police. Critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases.",Moderator,female,3,1,260
Lindsey Davis,NA,The ACLU's legal director in Minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice. Do you wish now that you had done more?,Moderator,female,3,1,261
Amy Klobuchar,NA,That's not my record.,Candidate,female,3,1,262
Unknown,NA,(inaudible),Moderator,unknown,3,1,263
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We are here at a historically black college. And I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said. She said, ""What the people want is simple; they want a country as good as its promise.""",Candidate,female,3,1,264
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis.",Candidate,female,3,1,265
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury. That's how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself.",Candidate,female,3,1,266
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids.",Candidate,female,3,1,267
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it. When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups; we put up billboards; we found the shooter and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.",Candidate,female,3,1,268
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"What changes did we make? Go after white-collar crimes in a big way, diversity the office in a big way, work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID.",Candidate,female,3,1,269
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90 percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.",Candidate,female,3,1,270
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,271

Lindsey Davis,NA,You all believe that the war on drugs has put too many Americans behind bars.,Moderator,female,3,1,273
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison. Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough. Your response?",Moderator,female,3,1,274
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, first of all, let me say that, when I came back from law school, I had a job with a great - a big-time law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated. We were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months.",Candidate,male,3,1,275
Joe Biden,NA,"I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman - as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate, et cetera.",Candidate,male,3,1,276
Joe Biden,NA,The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation.,Candidate,male,3,1,277
Joe Biden,NA,"Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As - when we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.",Candidate,male,3,1,278
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,279
Joe Biden,NA,"We - I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them that when they get out - nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released - they shouldn't be in there; that should be a misdemeanor. They should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned.",Candidate,male,3,1,280
Joe Biden,NA,"When you finish your term in prison, you should be able not only to vote but have access to Pell grants, have access to be able to get housing...",Candidate,male,3,1,281

Joe Biden,NA,Thank you.,Candidate,male,3,1,285
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Senator Booker, 45 seconds to respond.",Moderator,female,3,1,286
Cory Booker,NA,"Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs. But if you are African-American, you are almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives.",Candidate,male,3,1,287
Cory Booker,NA,And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson says treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.,Candidate,male,3,1,288
Cory Booker,NA,"And so I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstrably now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say, when we are president of the United States; when I am president of the United States, we will release them.",Candidate,male,3,1,289
Cory Booker,NA,"And let me be specific. I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail.",Candidate,male,3,1,290
Cory Booker,NA,"If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long, and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now.",Candidate,male,3,1,291
Cory Booker,NA,"Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people. And I challenge you. Don't just say a big statement; back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long.",Candidate,male,3,1,292

And I know there are survivors from El Paso right here in the hall tonight.",Moderator,male,3,1,297
David Muir,NA,"Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you, because we all remember Sandy Hook. Twenty-six people died in that school, 20 of them children. Those first graders would be in eighth grade today.",Moderator,male,3,1,298
David Muir,NA,"At the time, there was a groundswell in this country to get something done. President Obama asked you to lead the push for gun control.",Moderator,male,3,1,299
David Muir,NA,"You have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, but four months after Sandy Hook, a measure to require expanded background checks died on the Senate floor.",Moderator,male,3,1,300
David Muir,NA,"If you couldn't get it done after Sandy Hook, why should voters give you another chance?",Moderator,male,3,1,301
Joe Biden,NA,Because I got it done before. I'm the only one up here that's ever beat the NRA -only one ever to beat the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that brought the Brady bill into - into focus and became law.,Candidate,male,3,1,302
Joe Biden,NA,"And so that's number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook, a number of things happened. It went from a cause to a movement. Look what's happened now. Mothers - the organization - mothers against violence - gun violence. We've seen what's happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change.",Candidate,male,3,1,303
Joe Biden,NA,"There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50 percent of gun - of gun - of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct.",Candidate,male,3,1,304

I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.",Candidate,female,3,1,336
Kamala Harris,NA,"And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing, to act, is just - it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.",Candidate,female,3,1,337
Kamala Harris,NA,"I was talking about this at one of my town halls, and - and this child who was eight years old, probably, came up to me - it was like it was a secret between the two of us, and he tugged on my jacket and he said, ""I had to have one of those drills.""",Candidate,female,3,1,338

The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-15s and AK-47s and those who were buying those weapons. And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there, folks who said, I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.",Candidate,male,3,1,361

That's what unites us.",Candidate,female,3,1,366
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"You know what else unites us? And I'll tell you this. What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell's desk, are three bills - universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-47s.",Candidate,female,3,1,367

David Muir,NA,"You have argued, if you need a license to drive a car in this country, you should have a license to buy a gun. Gun-owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun. This would require, as you know, Congress to pass legislation.",Moderator,male,3,1,375
David Muir,NA,"If Democrats can't get universal background checks, how would you get this done? And can you name one Republican colleague of yours in the Senate right now who would be onboard with this idea?",Moderator,male,3,1,376
Cory Booker,NA,"So, background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans. Eighty-three percent of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue.",Candidate,male,3,1,377
Cory Booker,NA,"Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing.",Candidate,male,3,1,378
Cory Booker,NA,But this is what I'm sorry about. I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.,Candidate,male,3,1,379
Cory Booker,NA,"You want to know how we get this done? We get this done by having a more courageous empathy, where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities. They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.",Candidate,male,3,1,380
Cory Booker,NA,"I will lead change on this issue, because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget, national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.",Candidate,male,3,1,381
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,382
David Muir,NA,"Senator Booker, thank you. A quick follow-up, though, because Americans watching tonight know the reality of Congress in Washington. I asked do you have a Republican colleague in the Senate who would be onboard with this idea to get this done?",Moderator,male,3,1,383
Cory Booker,NA,"You know, if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement. The number-one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry.",Candidate,male,3,1,384
Cory Booker,NA,"Think about this. We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined, from the Revolutionary War until now. This is not a side issue to me. It is a central issue to me.",Candidate,male,3,1,385
Cory Booker,NA,"That is the kind of fight - because the majority of homicide victims - we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine. We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency. Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun-owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.",Candidate,male,3,1,386

Joe Biden,NA,Go beat them.,Candidate,male,3,1,388
David Muir,NA,"Senator Booker, thank you. Senator Warren, I want to come to you next, because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with Republicans in the Senate. What can you get done on gun control?",Moderator,male,3,1,389
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So let's start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country.",Candidate,female,3,1,390
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And we agree on many steps we could take to fix it. My view on this is, we're going to - it's not going to be one and done on this. We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly.",Candidate,female,3,1,391
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But here's the deal. The question we need to ask is, when we've got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do - I like registration - want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets, why doesn't it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.",Candidate,female,3,1,392
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,393
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry. And unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.",Candidate,female,3,1,394
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Until we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country. We've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people.",Candidate,female,3,1,395
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,396
David Muir,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you. You bring up eliminating the filibuster, which means you would need simply a simple majority in a Republican Senate to get something done. I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this, because you've said before of this, if Donald Trump supports ending the filibuster, which he's talked about himself, you should be nervous. Would you support ending the filibuster?",Moderator,male,3,1,397
Bernie Sanders,NA,"No. But what I would support, absolutely, is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about, Medicare-for-all, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen, and you can do it in a variety of ways. You can do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is in order and what is not.",Candidate,male,3,1,398
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system, and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or, in this case, you've got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership.",Candidate,male,3,1,399
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,400

Jorge Ramos,NA,"We've been hearing a lot about what's been happening here in Texas. Only a few weeks ago, the deadliest massacre of Latinos, Latinos, in modern U.S. history happened in this state, in El Paso. So the fear among Latinos - and you know this - is very real.",Moderator,male,3,1,404
Jorge Ramos,NA,"So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country: immigration. Vice President Biden, as a presidential candidate, in 2008, you supported the border wall, saying, ""Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence."" This is what you said.",Moderator,male,3,1,405
Jorge Ramos,NA,"Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in U.S. history. Did you do anything to prevent those deportations? I mean, you've been asked this question before and refused to answer, so let me try once again. Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations? Why should Latinos trust you?",Moderator,male,3,1,406
Joe Biden,NA,"What Latinos should look at is - comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one. We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things, number one.",Candidate,male,3,1,407
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two - number two, by the time - this is a president who came along with the DACA program. No one had ever done that before. This is the president that sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is a president who's done a great deal. So I'm proud to have served with him.",Candidate,male,3,1,408
Joe Biden,NA,"What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed. I would, in fact, make sure that there is - we immediately surge to the border. All those people who are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation who says, if you want to flee, and you're freeing oppression, you should come.",Candidate,male,3,1,409
Joe Biden,NA,"I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.",Candidate,male,3,1,410
Joe Biden,NA,"And by the way, retrospectively, you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Let's put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act. Now (inaudible) back...",Candidate,male,3,1,411

Julian Castro,NA,"I mean, look...",Candidate,male,3,1,419
Jorge Ramos,NA,"And let me put this in context, because your party controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and didn't pass immigration reform, and this broke a promise made by President Barack Obama to Latinos. So why should voters trust Democrats now? I mean, now it is even more difficult, as you know, because you need Republican votes in the Senate. So are you willing, for instance, to give up DACA or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize 10.5 million undocumented immigrants?",Moderator,male,3,1,420
Julian Castro,NA,"Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And, look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that's very different from Barack Obama.",Candidate,male,3,1,421
Julian Castro,NA,"But my problem with Vice President Biden - and Cory pointed this out last time - is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too, and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, well, that was the president. I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions. I mean...",Candidate,male,3,1,422

Because I'm not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. I'm not going to back pedal. I'm not going to pretend like I don't have my own vision for immigration.",Candidate,male,3,1,429
Julian Castro,NA,"So we're not going to give up DACA. We're not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20, 2021, we're going to have a Democratic president, we're going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House, and we're going to pass immigration reform within the first 100 days.",Candidate,male,3,1,430

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our DREAMers, but also for their grandparents, and for their cousins, for people who have overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable.",Candidate,female,3,1,438
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer, and it is not serving our values.",Candidate,female,3,1,439

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We need - I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering.",Candidate,female,3,1,442
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,443
Elizabeth Warren,NA,We need to restore that help. We need to help establish and re-establish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives.

Jorge Ramos,NA,"Mr. Yang? It is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe anti-immigrant measures, from putting kids in cages to limiting asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence. But it is also true about 1 million immigrants enter the U.S. legally every year. So, are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from 1 million to 2 million per year?

In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went into ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him.",Candidate,male,3,1,464
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"In some of the most conservative, rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow. And that's why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city.",Candidate,male,3,1,465
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"You know, the only reason that South Bend is growing right now, after years of shrinking, is immigration. It's one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington, to create city-issued municipal IDs, so that people, regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.",Candidate,male,3,1,466
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We have an opportunity to actually get something done. But we cannot allow this continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I do. And if you read the rest of that article in The Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry/exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa over-stays.",Candidate,male,3,1,470

The U.S. relationship with China, trade, and President Trump's tariffs. We received more than 100 questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs.",Moderator,male,3,1,486
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"And, Mr. Yang, let me begin with you. Would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office? And if so, would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with China?",Moderator,male,3,1,487
Andrew Yang,NA,"I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal, because right now, the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.",Candidate,male,3,1,488
Andrew Yang,NA,"A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said, one, how can my workers compete against that? And, two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.",Candidate,male,3,1,489
Andrew Yang,NA,"So, the imbalances are real. But we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides.",Candidate,male,3,1,490
Andrew Yang,NA,"So, no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.",Candidate,male,3,1,491

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Is it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April? It's one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage, people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans. And when that happens, there are serious consequences.",Candidate,male,3,1,497
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We saw it at the G7. The leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been.",Candidate,male,3,1,498
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The problem is, this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever, whether it's in Hong Kong, where those protesters for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States, or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America, but it can't be just any America.",Candidate,male,3,1,499
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Would you repeal the tariffs?,Moderator,male,3,1,500
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but it's not about the tariffs. Look, what's going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and there's a lack of a bigger strategy.",Candidate,male,3,1,501
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you've actually supported the tariffs on steel.",Moderator,male,3,1,502
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"What we've got right now, though, George, it's not a focused tariff on steel. What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies. He has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country.",Candidate,female,3,1,503
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"One forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300,000 jobs, all right? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest, in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa.",Candidate,female,3,1,504
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table - that's what I would do. I wouldn't have put all these tariffs in place. And I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces he's going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13th, he cuts it in half, a week later, he says he's going to reduce taxes, the day after that, he says he's going to do it.",Candidate,female,3,1,505
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"The leaders of the world are watching this, and it undermines our strength as a nation. And, yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world. And he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement, like we've done in northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that, so that our workers can benefit, so we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it's a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things, and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.",Candidate,female,3,1,506
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Secretary Castro, you actually, in one of the previous debates, identified China as the most serious national security threat to our country. I want to pick up on what Senator Klobuchar was saying. She said she would go back to the negotiating table. The question is, what do you do for leverage? Where do you get it?",Moderator,male,3,1,507
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs. It's estimated that it's cost $600 to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago, 60 percent of Americans said that they believe that we're in for a recession next year.",Candidate,male,3,1,508
Julian Castro,NA,"So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe, though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights.",Candidate,male,3,1,509

Julian Castro,NA,"And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that. We need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights. When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion.",Candidate,male,3,1,512
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Warren, let me bring you in on this conversation. President Obama signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In part, it was designed to rein in China, to bring China into some kind of regulation. What do you think he got wrong?",Moderator,male,3,1,513
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades, and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else.

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And yet for decades now, who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators? Who has shaped our trade policy? It's been the giant corporations. It's been their lobbyists and their executives.",Candidate,female,3,1,515
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"The way we change our trade policy in America is, first, the procedures. Who sits at the table? I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table. I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table.",Candidate,female,3,1,516
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And you asked the question about leverage. If I can just respond to that one, the leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, you want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then you got to raise your standards. You've got to raise your labor standards. You've got to raise your environmental standards...",Candidate,female,3,1,517
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,518
Elizabeth Warren,NA,... so our companies can compete on a level playing field. We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.,Candidate,female,3,1,519
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,520
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Harris, how would your trade policy differ from President Obama's?",Moderator,male,3,1,521
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, first of all, I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy.",Candidate,female,3,1,522
Kamala Harris,NA,"When we look at this issue, my trade policy, under a Harris administration, is always going to be about saying, we need to export American products, not American jobs. And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.",Candidate,female,3,1,523
Kamala Harris,NA,"I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff. And that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.",Candidate,female,3,1,524
Kamala Harris,NA,"You asked earlier about China. It's a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable.",Candidate,female,3,1,525
Kamala Harris,NA,We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on - and I think the only person on this stage - the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea.,Candidate,female,3,1,526
Kamala Harris,NA,"But the bottom line is this. Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?",Candidate,female,3,1,527
Kamala Harris,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,528
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Okay. I'm not even going to take the bait, Senator Harris. But I am going to take...",Moderator,male,3,1,529
Kamala Harris,NA,"Oh, George, it wasn't about you.",Candidate,female,3,1,530
George Stephanopoulos,NA,I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders right now.,Moderator,male,3,1,531
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, there is a reason - there is a reason why, in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that, for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies.",Candidate,male,3,1,532
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I got to say to my good friend, Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs.",Candidate,male,3,1,533
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,534
Bernie Sanders,NA,And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50 percent of what they made in manufacturing.,Candidate,male,3,1,535
Bernie Sanders,NA,"So Trump, obviously, hasn't a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at 3 o'clock in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere, who are losing billions right now because of Trump's policy, a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad, and then thinks they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.",Candidate,male,3,1,536
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Vice President Biden, he invoked your name.",Moderator,male,3,1,537
Joe Biden,NA,"Yeah, well, look, we're either going to make policy or China's going to make the rules of the road. We make up 25 percent of the world economy. We need another 25 percent to join us.",Candidate,male,3,1,538
Joe Biden,NA,"And I think Elizabeth - Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists. The fact of the matter is, China - the problem isn't the trade deficit, the problem is they're stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they're violating the WTO. They're dumping steel on us. That's a different issue than whether or not they're dumping agricultural products on us.",Candidate,male,3,1,539
Joe Biden,NA,"In addition to that, we're in a position where, if we don't set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China, to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.",Candidate,male,3,1,540
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Booker, close out this round.",Moderator,male,3,1,541
Cory Booker,NA,"Sure. There's one point we're really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump's America first policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy.",Candidate,male,3,1,542
Joe Biden,NA,Exactly right.,Candidate,male,3,1,543
Cory Booker,NA,"From trade to battling China to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris climate accords.",Candidate,male,3,1,544
Cory Booker,NA,"And on trade, he's deciding to take on China, while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies. You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now, look, I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat.",Candidate,male,3,1,545
Cory Booker,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,546
Cory Booker,NA,"We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators, like Duterte and Putin, than he does with Merkel and Macron. We are the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. That's how we beat China. That's how we beat climate change on the planet Earth, and that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers' rights.",Candidate,male,3,1,547
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,548
George Stephanopoulos,NA,David?,Moderator,male,3,1,549
David Muir,NA,"George, thank you. I want to turn now to our troops overseas and to America's longest war in Afghanistan. U.S. talks with the Taliban are dead, according to the president. Secret talks at Camp David have been canceled before they could happen. Many of you have weighed in on that already, so I want to move past that tonight to what all of you have promised on the campaign trail.",Moderator,male,3,1,550
David Muir,NA,"Many of you on this stage have said you'd bring the troops home in your first term. Others have said in your first year. Senator Warren, we all know the presidency is much different from the campaign trail. President Obama wanted to bring the troops home. President Trump promised to bring the troops home. And you have said of Afghanistan, let's help them reach a peace settlement. It is time to bring our troops home, in your words, starting right now. Would you keep that promise to bring the troops home starting right now with no deal with the Taliban?",Moderator,male,3,1,551
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Yes. And I'll tell you why. What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States. It is not helping the safety and security of the world. It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home.,Candidate,female,3,1,552
Elizabeth Warren,NA,And then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.,Candidate,female,3,1,553
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,3,1,554
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism.",Candidate,female,3,1,555
Elizabeth Warren,NA,It means using all of our tools. It means economic investment. It means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values.,Candidate,female,3,1,556
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Warren, a quick follow on that, because top U.S. leaders, military leaders on the ground in Afghanistan told me you can't do it without a deal with the Taliban. You just said you would, you would bring them home. What if they told you that? Would you listen to their advice?",Moderator,male,3,1,557
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer. I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick. And I talked to people - we did - we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders, we talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: Show me what winning looks like. Tell me what it looks like.",Candidate,female,3,1,558
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And what you hear is a lot of, ""Uh,"" because no one can describe it. And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.",Candidate,female,3,1,559
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I have three older brothers who all served in the military. I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do. But we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve.,Candidate,female,3,1,560
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. We need to build with our allies. And we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.",Candidate,female,3,1,561
David Muir,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you.",Moderator,male,3,1,562
David Muir,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,3,1,563
David Muir,NA,"I do want to stay on this, and I want to turn to Mayor Buttigieg, because you're the only veteran on this stage. You served in Afghanistan. We heard in recent days from General Joseph Dunford, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in recent days, ""I'm not going to use the word withdrawal right now. It's our judgment the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence."" If he's not even using the word withdrawal, would you put your promise to bring troops home in the first year on hold to follow the advice?",Moderator,male,3,1,564
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"You know, I served under General Dunford, way under General Dunford, in Afghanistan.",Candidate,male,3,1,565
Pete Buttigieg,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,566
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And today, September 12, 2019, means that today you could be 18 years old, old enough to serve, and had not been alive on 9/11. We have got to put an end to endless war.",Candidate,male,3,1,567
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland, and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops.",Candidate,male,3,1,568
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Let me say something else, because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.",Candidate,male,3,1,569
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,570
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there.",Candidate,male,3,1,571
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,572
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment. We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels?",Candidate,male,3,1,573
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I'll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform, is do not let these men and women down. This president is doing exactly that. I will not.",Candidate,male,3,1,574
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,575
David Muir,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.",Moderator,male,3,1,576
David Muir,NA,"I want to turn to Vice President Biden, because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan, if you pulled the U.S. troops out, has been heightened by what we've seen in recent days on the ground in Iraq.",Moderator,male,3,1,577
David Muir,NA,"When you were vice president, President Obama turned to you to bring the troops home from Iraq. You have said on the campaign trail, quote, ""I made sure the president turned to me and said, Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq."" There was a major drawdown of U.S. troops, and then ISIS seized by some estimates 40 percent of the territory in Iraq. You then had to send thousands of troops back in. Was it wrong to pull out of Iraq that quickly? And did the move actually help ISIS take hold?",Moderator,male,3,1,578
Joe Biden,NA,"No, it wasn't wrong to pull out. But I want to answer your Afghanistan question. I've been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service. But I've been out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this - and it's an open secret, you reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan.",Candidate,male,3,1,579
Joe Biden,NA,"The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency, meaning that we're going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me say it again. It will not be put together. It's three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties - the three provinces in the east. They're not any part of - the Haqqanis run it. I will go on and on.",Candidate,male,3,1,580
Joe Biden,NA,But here's the point. The point is that it's a counterterrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases - insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to air lift from and to move against what we know.,Candidate,male,3,1,581
Joe Biden,NA,"We don't need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford's a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.",Candidate,male,3,1,582
Joe Biden,NA,"With regard to - with regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that, you know, I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the Security Council to vote 15-0 to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof.",Candidate,male,3,1,583
Joe Biden,NA,I said something that was not meant the way I said it.,Candidate,male,3,1,584
Joe Biden,NA,"I said - from that point on - what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way; there was no plan; we should not be engaged; we didn't have the people with us; we didn't have our - we didn't have allies with us, et cetera.",Candidate,male,3,1,585
Joe Biden,NA,"And it was later, when we came into office, that Barack turned - the president turned to me and said, ""Joe"" - when they said we've got a plan to get out, he turned to the whole security and said, ""Joe will organize this. Get the troops home.""",Candidate,male,3,1,586
Joe Biden,NA,"My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand. It made - and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming - from moving in.",Candidate,male,3,1,587
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice President, thank you.",Moderator,male,3,1,588
David Muir,NA,I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this. Because the concern over Afghanistan is very similar to what we saw in Iraq when the troops came out. ISIS filled that vacuum.,Moderator,male,3,1,589
David Muir,NA,"What do you make of people out there who are worried that if we pull out U.S. troops too quickly from Afghanistan, it will create safe haven all over again, like the plotters of 9/11?",Moderator,male,3,1,590
Bernie Sanders,NA,"David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said.",Candidate,male,3,1,591
Bernie Sanders,NA,"You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq...",Candidate,male,3,1,592
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,593

Bernie Sanders,NA,"... and helped lead the opposition. And it's sad to say - I mean, I, kind of, you know, had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war.",Candidate,male,3,1,597
Bernie Sanders,NA,"As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said. We cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend them - defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think, also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump's military budgets.",Candidate,male,3,1,598
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,599

Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,601
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together - bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism. And make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bomb on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.",Candidate,male,3,1,602

Andrew Yang,NA,"I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars. We've been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years, which is not what the American people want. We have to start owning what we can and can't do. We're not very good at rebuilding countries.",Candidate,male,3,1,607

Andrew Yang,NA,I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment. What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way.

What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make - can create their own future.",Candidate,male,3,1,620

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yes, we will follow through, regardless of the political consequences or who it offends, because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it.",Candidate,male,3,1,660
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050. That we are halfway there by 2030. That we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that. That we invest here in Houston, Texas, with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding given the fact that this town has seen three 500-year floods in just five years, you'd like to think you're good for 1,500 years, but you're not. They're coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever.",Candidate,male,3,1,661
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We're also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that. And that we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services they want to provide. Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil.",Candidate,male,3,1,662

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"On day four, five, and six I will, working with Congress and mayors and business people all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal. And on day seven, you're supposed to rest, but I won't. This is what we need to do if we're going to get at climate change. We have to take this on as a crisis that's happening right now.",Candidate,female,3,1,668
Jorge Ramos,NA,"Senator Warren, should American foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change?",Moderator,male,3,1,669

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But that means we've got to use all the tools. One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed following Governor Inslee, that we, by 2028, cut all carbon emissions from new buildings. By 2030, carbon emissions from cars. And by 2035, all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70 percent.",Candidate,female,3,1,671
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can do this. We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time. Why doesn't it happen? As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can't make the changes we need to make.

When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two-and-a-half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children and then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage.",Candidate,female,3,1,675
Kamala Harris,NA,"And this is an issue that, yes, it represents a existential threat. It is also something that we can do something about. This is a problem that was created by human behaviors.

I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress. If any of you have been to Los Angeles, 20 years ago, you'll remember, that sky was brown. You go there now, the sky is blue and you know why?

One of them, thousands of students are leaving traditional public schools and going to charter schools.",Moderator,female,3,1,690
Lindsey Davis,NA,"You're the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools. You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, ""just jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice.""

Some of it is extremely simple, we have just got to pay teachers more. And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.",Candidate,male,3,1,704
Pete Buttigieg,NA,I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher. And they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well. And she came up just short.,Candidate,male,3,1,705
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So, you know what she did? Since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fall-back plan, she became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession. If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession.

In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, ""I don't feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I'll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.""",Moderator,female,3,1,747

Joe Biden,NA,"Well, they have to deal with the - look, there's institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Red-lining banks, making sure that we are in a position where - look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out - the $60,000 level.",Candidate,male,3,1,749
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we need - we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It's crazy.",Candidate,male,3,1,750
Joe Biden,NA,"The teachers are - I'm married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have - make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.",Candidate,male,3,1,751

In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools.",Candidate,male,3,1,763
Julian Castro,NA,"And I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now, I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED, and health care opportunities, and those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.",Candidate,male,3,1,764
Julian Castro,NA,"Those are the types of things that we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They're not.",Candidate,male,3,1,765

Lindsey Davis,NA,"Nonwhite districts typically receive $2,200 less per student than those in white districts. This means older books, less access to computers, and often worse outcomes. What is your plan to address segregation? And I'm not just talking about the achievement gap, but I'm talking about the opportunity gap in education.",Moderator,female,3,1,770
Cory Booker,NA,"So, I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that - and the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I've lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius.",Candidate,male,3,1,771
Cory Booker,NA,"I think I'm the only person on the stage - even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system - I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results. A lot of folks here are talking about raising teacher salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.",Candidate,male,3,1,772
Cory Booker,NA,"And we didn't stop there. Yeah, we closed poor-performing charter schools, but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community. The results speak for themselves. We're now the number-one city in America for Beat the Odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.",Candidate,male,3,1,773
Cory Booker,NA,"Strategies like investing in our children work. And I'll tell you this. I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues.",Candidate,male,3,1,774
Cory Booker,NA,"That's why my friend, Secretary Castro, is 100 percent right. We are in the reality we are right now because, Mr. Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime, that were red-lining communities, disinvesting in communities, and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they're also struggling with environmental injustice.",Candidate,male,3,1,775
Cory Booker,NA,"If you've talked to someone who's a parent of a child has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you'll know this is a national problem, because there's over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.",Candidate,male,3,1,776
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,3,1,777

George Stephanopoulos,NA,"And, candidates, the question is on the quality of resilience. No president can succeed without resilience. Every president confronts crises, defeats, and mistakes.

Joe Biden,NA,"There's setbacks, and there's setbacks. And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose - well, my dad had an expression. He said, Joey, it's not a question of succeeding, whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. And he said, you never explain and never complain. And then he would go on to say that the only obligation that really matters, the most important thing, is family.",Candidate,male,3,1,793
Joe Biden,NA,"And so I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family, and could be judged on based how you treatment your family and how you went from there. And I - it took - you know, Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark. Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured. And I just had been elected, not sworn in. And I lost my faith for a while. I came back.",Candidate,male,3,1,794
Joe Biden,NA,"And then later, when my son Beau came home from Iraq and - with a terminal disease, and a year later, year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul.",Candidate,male,3,1,795
Joe Biden,NA,"But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do. And that's why I hope - I hope he's proud of me today, because he wanted to make sure I didn't run for president, but I stayed engaged, because when you get hit badly, whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you can't live here anymore, Dad lost his job, you know, we've all been through that, in some form or another.",Candidate,male,3,1,796
Joe Biden,NA,"And it just takes - it just - for me, the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy. And - but there's a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another, without the help I had.

Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over.",Candidate,female,3,1,802
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston. And I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had 4- to 6-year-olds.,Candidate,female,3,1,803
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me - wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.",Candidate,female,3,1,804
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, there I am, I'm at home, I got a baby, I can't have a job. What am I going to do? Here's resilience. I said, I'll go to law school. And the consequence was - I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which was teaching.",Candidate,female,3,1,805
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But it let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. And the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. I know what's broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America. That's why I'm here.",Candidate,female,3,1,806

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Professional resilience means to me, George, running for U.S. Senate in Vermont and getting 1 percent of the vote, running for governor and getting 2 percent of the vote, finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont, with a 10-vote margin.",Candidate,male,3,1,811
Bernie Sanders,NA,"What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex.",Candidate,male,3,1,812
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I feel confident that given a lifelong record of taking on powerful special interests, of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us, not just the 1 percent.",Candidate,male,3,1,813

When I ran for D.A., I won and became the first black woman elected D.A. in a state of 40 million people, in San Francisco.",Candidate,female,3,1,816
Kamala Harris,NA,"When I ran for attorney general of California, I was elected - because I didn't listen. And I was the only black elected - woman black elected attorney general in the state - in the country.",Candidate,female,3,1,817
Kamala Harris,NA,"And each time, people would say, it's not your time, it's not your turn, it's going to be too difficult, they're not ready for you, and I didn't listen. And a part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me, including don't you let anybody ever tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.",Candidate,female,3,1,818

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"You know, as a military officer serving under ""don't ask/don't tell,"" and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback.",Candidate,male,3,1,824
Pete Buttigieg,NA,I came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life.,Candidate,male,3,1,825
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community.",Candidate,male,3,1,826
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"What happened was that, when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with 80 percent of the vote. And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning.",Candidate,male,3,1,827
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I think that's what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about. And this election is not about any of us up here. It is not about this president, even though it's hard to talk of anything else some days.",Candidate,male,3,1,828
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It's about the people who trust us with their lives, a kid wondering if we're actually going to make their schools safe when they've learned active shooter drills before they've learned to read, a generation wondering we will actually get the job done on climate change. And if we hold to that, then it doesn't matter what happens to each of us professionally. Together, we will win a better era for our country.",Candidate,male,3,1,829

If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you're going to do it. And then you don't have a choice. You put your heart and soul into that. And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini-rise and maximum fall.",Candidate,male,3,1,833
Andrew Yang,NA,"I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer. It was a little easier.",Candidate,male,3,1,834
Andrew Yang,NA,"So I remember lying on my floor looking up wondering, how did it come to this? Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years and eventually had some success.",Candidate,male,3,1,835
Andrew Yang,NA,"Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. And so I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Nguyen, who's here in the audience tonight, who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me.",Candidate,male,3,1,836

Cory Booker,NA,"So my biggest professional setback is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey, in 2002 took on the political machine and, boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle. And we lost that election.",Candidate,male,3,1,841
Cory Booker,NA,"And here's a bit of advice to everybody. If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called ""Street Fight."" But then, unfortunately, another setback. It lost in the Oscars to a movie called ""March of the Dagnab Penguins,"" for crying out loud.",Candidate,male,3,1,842

Cory Booker,NA,"The people in my community, living in the projects, told me, don't give up on the people and the people won't give up on you.

Cory Booker,NA,"But more than that, the lesson was there. We didn't give up. We were taking on America's toughest problems, from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system.",Candidate,male,3,1,845
Cory Booker,NA,"There's more work to do, but I haven't given up on the people. I still live in that community. But this is a big lesson. My staff and my friends and my community told me, if you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor's race, but that's not what life is about. There's an old African saying that says, if you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.",Candidate,male,3,1,846
Cory Booker,NA,"The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. And the test of America right now is not a referendum on Donald Trump, it's a referendum on us and who we are and who we're going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation.",Candidate,male,3,1,847

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Thank you, George. Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States, that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that.",Candidate,male,3,1,851
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country. We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security, and to our safety.",Candidate,male,3,1,852
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims. He's the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girls soccer team of 10- and 11-year-old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he's still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team.",Candidate,male,3,1,853
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica and Marcella, their wives, they exemplify resilience to me. And when we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we're defined not by our fears, but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be, in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.",Candidate,male,3,1,854

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Thank you. My challenges and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And after his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment, with his faith, with his friends, with our family. And in his words, he was pursued by grace. And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right, to be pursued by grace.",Candidate,female,3,1,858
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I then got married. My husband's out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter. When our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we're going to have this perfect, perfect birth, and she was really sick, and she couldn't swallow. And she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half.",Candidate,female,3,1,859
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out. And I thought, this could never happen to any other mom again.",Candidate,female,3,1,860
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay. And when they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyists 2 to 1. And when they said, when should it take place, they all raised their hands and said now.",Candidate,female,3,1,861
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That is what motivated me to go into public service. And when I got to that gridlock of Washington, D.C., I got to work and pass over 100 bills, and I know a lot of my friends here from the left, but remember, I am from the middle of the country. And I believe, if we're going to get things done, that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit, someone who's going to not just change the policies, but change the tone in the country, and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.",Candidate,female,3,1,862

George Stephanopoulos,NA,Secretary Castro?,Moderator,male,3,1,864
Julian Castro,NA,"And thank you, George, to Jorge, to Linsey, and to David, and to all of y'all for tuning in tonight. In many ways, I shouldn't be here on this stage. You know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her. I grew up in a single-parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools. Eventually, my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals.",Candidate,male,3,1,865
Julian Castro,NA,"And when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000. A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council. And the city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year, so everybody had another job. And my job was at the law firm.",Candidate,male,3,1,866
Julian Castro,NA,"Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client and the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn't think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it.",Candidate,male,3,1,867
Julian Castro,NA,"But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas - because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules - you can't just go against the interest of a client. So I was stuck.",Candidate,male,3,1,868
Julian Castro,NA,"On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment, depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out.",Candidate,male,3,1,869
Julian Castro,NA,"So, one day, I walked into my law firm and I quit my job. And then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council.",Candidate,male,3,1,870
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,3,1,871
Julian Castro,NA,"And, you know, it was the first test that I had, and I think back to that, because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting. I wondered, before I went in it, whether it was change who I was. And I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent, and not for big special interests.",Candidate,male,3,1,872
Julian Castro,NA,"There's nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States. This president has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won't. I won't serve anybody except you and your family. And together, we can create an American that's better than ever.

Anderson Cooper,NA,"I'm Anderson Cooper moderating tonight's debate, along with CNN's Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey. We are in Ohio tonight, because it's one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.",Moderator,male,4,1,3
Erin Burnett,NA,"The top 12 Democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate, so to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.",Moderator,female,4,1,4
Mark Lacey,NA,"Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.",Moderator,male,4,1,5
Anderson Cooper,NA,"And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let's begin.",Moderator,male,4,1,6
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn't it be the voters who determine the president's fate?",Moderator,male,4,1,7
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry.,Candidate,female,4,1,8
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.",Candidate,female,4,1,9
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Now, that didn't happen. And look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.",Candidate,female,4,1,10
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.",Candidate,female,4,1,11
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren. You're all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any chance but to impeach President Trump? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,12
Bernie Sanders,NA,"No, they don't. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller Report. I think that the House will find him guilty of - worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.",Candidate,male,4,1,13
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.",Candidate,male,4,1,14
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, ""The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision."" With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?",Moderator,male,4,1,15
Joe Biden,NA,"Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice - no choice - but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.",Candidate,male,4,1,16
Joe Biden,NA,"This president - and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders - is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.",Candidate,male,4,1,17
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president?",Moderator,male,4,1,18
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, it's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.",Candidate,female,4,1,19
Kamala Harris,NA,"During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.",Candidate,female,4,1,20
Kamala Harris,NA,"Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.",Candidate,female,4,1,21
Kamala Harris,NA,"But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.",Candidate,female,4,1,22
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's, quote, ""moral vandalism"" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,23
Cory Booker,NA,"So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.",Candidate,male,4,1,24
Cory Booker,NA,"Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart.",Candidate,male,4,1,25
Cory Booker,NA,"Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.",Candidate,male,4,1,26
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Thank you, Senator Booker.",Moderator,male,4,1,27
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you have - what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, health care, the economy, and could backfire on Democrats?",Moderator,male,4,1,28
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.",Candidate,female,4,1,29
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that.",Candidate,female,4,1,30
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.",Candidate,female,4,1,31
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers' issues, whether it is farmers' issues, he has put his own private interests ...",Candidate,female,4,1,32
Anderson Cooper,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,4,1,33
Amy Klobuchar,NA,... and I will not do that.,Candidate,female,4,1,34
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction?",Moderator,male,4,1,35
Julian Castro,NA,"Not at all. We can walk and chew gun at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.",Candidate,male,4,1,36
Julian Castro,NA,"Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly - in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power.",Candidate,male,4,1,37
Julian Castro,NA,"We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.",Candidate,male,4,1,38
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Mayer Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There's been, obviously, very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?",Moderator,male,4,1,39
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans, who enable the president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.",Candidate,male,4,1,40
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It's also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.",Candidate,male,4,1,41
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.",Candidate,male,4,1,42
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It starts out feeling like a happy thought; this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we'll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.",Candidate,male,4,1,43
Pete Buttigieg,NA,I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.,Candidate,male,4,1,44
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House member on this stage. How do you respond?",Moderator,male,4,1,45
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we're already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.",Candidate,female,4,1,46
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.",Candidate,female,4,1,47
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.",Candidate,female,4,1,48

Tom Steyer,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,52
Tom Steyer,NA,"But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They're the voice that counts, and that's who I went to, the American people.",Candidate,male,4,1,53
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Mr. Yang, do you think there's already enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,54
Andrew Yang,NA,"I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.",Candidate,male,4,1,55
Andrew Yang,NA,"Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns. And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands.",Candidate,male,4,1,56
Andrew Yang,NA,"It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.",Candidate,male,4,1,57
Andrew Yang,NA,"The fact is, Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,4,1,58

We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice.",Candidate,male,4,1,60
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.",Candidate,male,4,1,61

Beto O'Rourke,NA,And we cannot do that.,Candidate,male,4,1,65
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.",Moderator,male,4,1,66
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it's not okay for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?",Moderator,male,4,1,67
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.",Candidate,male,4,1,68
Joe Biden,NA,And what I wanted to make a point about - and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.,Candidate,male,4,1,69
Joe Biden,NA,"On the - look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions - three occasions - has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.",Candidate,male,4,1,70
Joe Biden,NA,"Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.",Candidate,male,4,1,71

Anderson Cooper,NA,"Hold on, sorry, just to follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer.",Moderator,male,4,1,73
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.",Candidate,male,4,1,74
Joe Biden,NA,My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.,Candidate,male,4,1,75
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Sanders, your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,76
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.",Candidate,male,4,1,77

Unknown,NA,It is wrong to move on.,Moderator,unknown,4,1,88
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt. And you've said how you're going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?",Moderator,male,4,1,89
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is, I have been out all around this country. I've done 140 town halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico. Shoot, I've done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.",Candidate,female,4,1,90
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.",Candidate,female,4,1,91
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.",Candidate,female,4,1,92
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if your mom has diabetes, or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with MS. But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your health care after that.",Candidate,female,4,1,93
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?",Moderator,male,4,1,94
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.",Candidate,female,4,1,95
Mark Lacey,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, ""evasive"" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all. What's your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,96
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.",Candidate,male,4,1,97
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is, we really can deliver health care for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.",Candidate,male,4,1,98
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes-or-no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare. We let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that, too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your health care and for your family. And it can be delivered without an increase on the middle-class taxes.",Candidate,male,4,1,99
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,100
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.",Candidate,female,4,1,101
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Medicare for all is the gold standard. It is the way we get health care coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who's just gotten an MS diagnosis. That's how we make sure that everyone gets health care.",Candidate,female,4,1,102
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.",Candidate,female,4,1,103

Elizabeth Warren,NA,Sure.,Candidate,female,4,1,108
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.",Candidate,male,4,1,109
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big, bold goal -- and once again, we have a president -- we're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?",Candidate,male,4,1,110
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders?",Moderator,male,4,1,111
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I'd like to be able to respond...,Candidate,female,4,1,112
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do.",Candidate,male,4,1,113
Bernie Sanders,NA,"At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less -- substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.",Candidate,male,4,1,114
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, at least that's a straightforward answer, but there's a better way.",Candidate,male,4,1,115
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?",Moderator,male,4,1,116
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, ""Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.""",Candidate,female,4,1,117

And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.",Candidate,female,4,1,120
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in our years.,Candidate,female,4,1,121
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I'm tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that's going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold, that will cover more people, and it's the one we should get behind.",Candidate,female,4,1,122

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of health care. And, look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I've put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part is that is we have got to stop...",Candidate,female,4,1,125

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.",Candidate,female,4,1,129
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times, is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. That is long-term care. We are seeing -- I once called it a silver tsunami. The aging -- and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge -- the aging of the population.",Candidate,female,4,1,130
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We need to make easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid.

Joe Biden,NA,"But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.",Candidate,male,4,1,139
Joe Biden,NA,"And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that, in fact, it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000, because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, 7.4 percent plus, or 5 percent, plus a 4 percent income tax. If you're making -- if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.",Candidate,male,4,1,140

Andrew Yang,NA,"The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.",Candidate,male,4,1,166
Andrew Yang,NA,"Also, Senator Sanders, the description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.",Candidate,male,4,1,167
Andrew Yang,NA,"Because the fact is -- and you know this in Ohio -- if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do.

And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. And the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.",Candidate,male,4,1,171
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,172
Cory Booker,NA,"And I'm having deja vu all over again. And I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another health care debate, and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala, but you know what?

Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, ""a good story, except it's not really true."" So should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?",Moderator,female,4,1,179
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So the data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.",Candidate,female,4,1,180
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I have a plan to fix that, and it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40 percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?",Candidate,female,4,1,181

Julian Castro,NA,"Well, I think -- I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? You know, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I'm even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work.",Candidate,male,4,1,187
Julian Castro,NA,"But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.",Candidate,male,4,1,188
Julian Castro,NA,"I was in Newton, Iowa, a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa, had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down.

Erin Burnett,NA,"Go ahead, Mr. Yang.",Moderator,female,4,1,194
Andrew Yang,NA,"Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.",Candidate,male,4,1,195
Andrew Yang,NA,"What is that going to mean for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal?

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It's one of the reasons that I've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.",Candidate,female,4,1,200
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty. And it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more.

They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.",Candidate,female,4,1,211
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"And I agree with my friend, Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.",Candidate,female,4,1,212
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This has to do with bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.",Candidate,female,4,1,213

Mark Lacey,NA,"One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it's 72nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.",Moderator,male,4,1,215
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?",Moderator,male,4,1,216
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation -- and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this -- doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.",Candidate,male,4,1,217
Cory Booker,NA,"We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And, number one, you start having trade deals, not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal.",Candidate,male,4,1,218
Cory Booker,NA,"We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.",Candidate,male,4,1,219
Cory Booker,NA,"But it's more than that. I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because, right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.",Candidate,male,4,1,220
Cory Booker,NA,"So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.",Candidate,male,4,1,221

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there.",Candidate,male,4,1,224
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"What they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.",Candidate,male,4,1,225
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country, and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.",Candidate,male,4,1,226

Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, ""Billionaires should not exist."" Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?",Moderator,female,4,1,229
Bernie Sanders,NA,"When you have a half-a-million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 people -- 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.",Candidate,male,4,1,230

There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It's absolutely wrong. It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.",Candidate,male,4,1,236
Tom Steyer,NA,"I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.

Tom Steyer,NA,"As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $20 bucks.",Candidate,male,4,1,238
Tom Steyer,NA,"There's something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed.

It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.",Candidate,male,4,1,246
Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there's $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can't justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.",Candidate,male,4,1,247

She'd come home, she'd cook dinner, and at some point we'd go to bed, and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.",Candidate,female,4,1,289

Kamala Harris,NA,"So when I think about this issue, I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table, after everyone's gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how it's going to make -- how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he's going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he's going to miss his kids' soccer games.",Candidate,female,4,1,291

The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.",Candidate,male,4,1,296
Andrew Yang,NA,"If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.",Candidate,male,4,1,297

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.",Candidate,male,4,1,301

I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for.",Candidate,female,4,1,307

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase?",Candidate,male,4,1,318

Julian Castro,NA,"I grew up like I bet a lot folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother, Joaquin, in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother. And we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off.",Candidate,male,4,1,326
Julian Castro,NA,"And when I was a kid, to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter, and that's what's happening to a lot of families these days. I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and I visited people who were homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.",Candidate,male,4,1,327

Cory Booker,NA,"It didn't work in 2016, and it will be a disaster for us in 2020. And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren. I have a different plan than many people on this stage. And it involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there. But we've had 20 years of presidential debates, and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty.",Candidate,male,4,1,335
Cory Booker,NA,"We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.",Candidate,male,4,1,336
Cory Booker,NA,"My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we're against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for.",Candidate,male,4,1,337

Anderson Cooper,NA,"And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.",Moderator,male,4,1,342
Anderson Cooper,NA,"I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from northern Syria, abandoning America's long-time Kurdish allies. As a result, Turkey has now evaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government in Damascus, a victory for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and Russia, and Iran.",Moderator,male,4,1,343
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process. So would you send American troops back into northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies?",Moderator,male,4,1,344
Joe Biden,NA,"I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in, they'll only go to Europe and won't affect us.",Candidate,male,4,1,345
Joe Biden,NA,"It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history -- excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I've never seen a time -- and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what's happening here.",Candidate,male,4,1,346
Joe Biden,NA,"What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he's going to have a problem -- because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.",Candidate,male,4,1,347
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in northern Syria?",Moderator,male,4,1,348

They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.",Candidate,male,4,1,349
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,350
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, last week you said that American troops should get out of Syria now. You don't agree with how the president handled the withdrawal. What would you have done differently? How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we're seeing now?",Moderator,male,4,1,351
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Well, first of all, we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.",Candidate,female,4,1,352
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.",Candidate,female,4,1,353
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Not only that, but the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.",Candidate,female,4,1,354
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things -- ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaida in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.",Candidate,female,4,1,355

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America.

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.",Candidate,male,4,1,366
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Look, I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it's also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.",Candidate,male,4,1,367
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed -- ashamed -- of what their country has done.

Anderson Cooper,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,375
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Yeah, absolutely. So, really, what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al Qaida, HTS, al-Nusra and others, because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war? That's really what you're saying?",Candidate,female,4,1,376

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"What we are doing -- or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.",Candidate,male,4,1,383
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.",Candidate,male,4,1,391
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people, in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, ""We're with you, we're standing with you."" And then suddenly, one day after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy.",Candidate,male,4,1,392
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States. In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.",Candidate,male,4,1,393
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,394
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But this is really important, because what this president has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies, too. Remember, the problem right now is not just that -- with our competitors. And, for example a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don't get a peep of support from the president. It's just not the behavior of adversaries like Russia.",Candidate,male,4,1,395

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here. And I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it and now he's too proud to say it.",Candidate,female,4,1,403
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say come back, Turkey, and stop this, because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mideast.",Candidate,female,4,1,404

Kamala Harris,NA,"And let's be clear. What Donald Trump has done, because of that phone call with Erdogan, is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a ""get out of jail free"" card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four: Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS.",Candidate,female,4,1,413

Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,419
Julian Castro,NA,"He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria. And just to connect the dots for a second, if you're Kim Jong-un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program, when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran's nuclear weapons program, and now he's abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?",Candidate,male,4,1,420

What specifically would you do as president to check Vladimir Putin's power on the world stage?",Moderator,male,4,1,423
Cory Booker,NA,"So, first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals like Mattis who said on the world stage, the United States of America, there can be no better friend than the United States of America and no better -- no greater enemy than the United States of America. This president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with Russia.",Candidate,male,4,1,424
Cory Booker,NA,"And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.",Candidate,male,4,1,425
Cory Booker,NA,"Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he's going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he's now given them a foothold again.",Candidate,male,4,1,426
Cory Booker,NA,"This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he's bringing our troops home, at the same time he's increasing troop presence with the Saudis, while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen.",Candidate,male,4,1,427

Joe Biden,NA,"I think I maybe -- it doesn't make me any better or worse, but maybe the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan.

Joe Biden,NA,"And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.",Candidate,male,4,1,439
Joe Biden,NA,"And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. That's why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.",Candidate,male,4,1,440
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President.",Moderator,male,4,1,441
Mark Lacey,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia's hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?",Moderator,male,4,1,442
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yes. We must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy and being able to do it thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.",Candidate,male,4,1,443
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage, we do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn't enough money in this country, there aren't enough servicemembers as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.",Candidate,male,4,1,444
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of servicemembers to fight those battles there.",Candidate,male,4,1,445
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers, one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy and our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals not on the backs of 18-, and 19-, and 20-year-olds any more, but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.",Candidate,male,4,1,446

Mark Lacey,NA,"Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,448
Tom Steyer,NA,"Absolutely. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump's America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners, has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it's proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.",Candidate,male,4,1,449
Tom Steyer,NA,"Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis. I've been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.",Candidate,male,4,1,450
Tom Steyer,NA,"So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies.

Mark Lacey,NA,"Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia.",Moderator,male,4,1,453
Andrew Yang,NA,"Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he's now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy.",Candidate,male,4,1,454
Andrew Yang,NA,"We have to let Russia know, look, we get it. We've tampered with other elections, you've tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this.",Candidate,male,4,1,455
Andrew Yang,NA,"But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats. Artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors, these are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology.",Candidate,male,4,1,456

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I want to respond to Mr. Yang. I don't see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election.",Candidate,female,4,1,462

Anderson Cooper,NA,"We want to turn back to domestic issues and the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We're less than 100 miles from Dayton, Ohio, where two months ago a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15-style weapon with a high-capacity magazine.",Moderator,male,4,1,470
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, in the last debate, you said, quote, ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" but when you were asked how you'd enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don't even know who has those weapons.",Moderator,male,4,1,471
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Look, we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s.",Candidate,male,4,1,472
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. Nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.",Candidate,male,4,1,473
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging, with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.",Candidate,male,4,1,474
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision surveyed them. More than 80 percent feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this president's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso.",Candidate,male,4,1,475
Anderson Cooper,NA,Congressman...,Moderator,male,4,1,476

Anderson Cooper,NA,OK.,Moderator,male,4,1,478
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, non-gun-owners alike to respect and follow the law.",Candidate,male,4,1,479
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Congressman, let me follow up. Just to follow up, your expectations aside, your website says you will fine people who don't give up their weapons. That doesn't take those weapons off the street. So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up and you don't know where they are?",Moderator,male,4,1,480
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, they will be other consequences from law enforcement.",Candidate,male,4,1,481

If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can't wait. People are dying in the streets right now.",Candidate,male,4,1,484
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.",Candidate,male,4,1,485
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, your response.",Moderator,male,4,1,486
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis. We've got to do something about it.",Candidate,male,4,1,487
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I'm describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war, but to use the analogy of health care, it would be as though we said, look, we're for primary care, but let's not talk about mental health care because that's a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let's save that for another day.",Candidate,male,4,1,488
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"No, let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we're going to achieve. And then let's bring this country together in order to do that.

Cory Booker,NA,"I'm living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gun shots are real every single day.",Candidate,male,4,1,509

We all have courage.",Candidate,male,4,1,510
Cory Booker,NA,"But it's frustrating that when the American people, 77 percent of Americans agree on licensing, we don't need leadership right now.

That's what we should be focusing on.",Candidate,female,4,1,520
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I just don't want to screw this up. When I'm president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio, will never happen again. But let's not mess this up with this fight.",Candidate,female,4,1,521

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you've rightly identified, it's not just about mass shootings.

Joe Biden,NA,"The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street -- or not on the street, that people own, is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.",Candidate,male,4,1,537
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm the only one that got -- got -- moved the -- to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I've done this. I know how to get it done.

Julian Castro,NA,"Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn't uncommon to hear gunshots at night. And I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other.",Candidate,male,4,1,542
Julian Castro,NA,"You know, in the neighborhoods -- let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one, folks can't define it. And if you're not going door to door, then it's not really mandatory.",Candidate,male,4,1,543
Julian Castro,NA,"But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn't even announced himself. And within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home.",Candidate,male,4,1,544
Julian Castro,NA,"And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.",Candidate,male,4,1,545
Julian Castro,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,546
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",Moderator,male,4,1,547
Mark Lacey,NA,"Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic, Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Brie, a teacher in Proctorville, asks, in rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has affected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily, witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?",Moderator,male,4,1,548
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember, when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it's gotten worse and worse. And we now know why.",Candidate,female,4,1,549
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the e-mail from one of the pharma executives that actually said, ""Keep pumping them out. They're eating them like Doritos.""",Candidate,female,4,1,550
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That's the first way.",Candidate,female,4,1,551
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And you can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help rural areas where they're so isolated, and also in urban areas, where it's, by the way, not just opiates. There are still mental health issues and crack cocaine issues.",Candidate,female,4,1,552
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And by his third DWI, they said to him, the prosecutor, you've got to face jail or you got to go to treatment. He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace. And he has been sober ever since. And now he's 91 and in assisted living, and he said to me last year, it's hard to get a drink around here, anyway. But he still has an AA group that visits him there.",Candidate,female,4,1,553
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.",Candidate,female,4,1,554
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,555
Tom Steyer,NA,"Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America has had, 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that's not only a tragedy for them, it's a tragedy for their family and their communities.",Candidate,male,4,1,556
Tom Steyer,NA,And so I think we have to treat this as a health citizens. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people.,Candidate,male,4,1,557
Tom Steyer,NA,But I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government. And we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want.,Candidate,male,4,1,558
Tom Steyer,NA,"We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I've put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a natural referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote",Candidate,male,4,1,559
Tom Steyer,NA,"These corporations have taken over our government. And 72,000 deaths...",Candidate,male,4,1,560

Tom Steyer,NA,... last year are the tragic result.,Candidate,male,4,1,562
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?",Moderator,male,4,1,563
Andrew Yang,NA,"That's exactly right. And we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate.",Candidate,male,4,1,564
Andrew Yang,NA,"They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2 percent fine, and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.",Candidate,male,4,1,565
Andrew Yang,NA,"So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our community so our people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem.",Candidate,male,4,1,566
Andrew Yang,NA,"And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is, after you save someone who's OD'ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.",Candidate,male,4,1,567
Andrew Yang,NA,"So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing. This was a systemic government failing. And then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.",Candidate,male,4,1,568
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O'Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,569
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described. And also just from some personal experiences I've had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions.",Candidate,male,4,1,570
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the V.A. Now, imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribe an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, ensured the V.A....",Candidate,male,4,1,571
Andrew Yang,NA,"Yes, preach, Beto.",Candidate,male,4,1,572
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"... could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who've been arrested for possession, and make sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.",Candidate,male,4,1,573
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we're going to continue to have this problem going on again. So that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system.",Candidate,male,4,1,574

Kamala Harris,NA,And I've seen it happen before. I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I've seen what they do.,Candidate,female,4,1,580
Kamala Harris,NA,"The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.",Candidate,female,4,1,581
Kamala Harris,NA,"And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And, yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice.",Candidate,female,4,1,582
Kamala Harris,NA,"And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice, understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let's end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs, and let's go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they've been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.",Candidate,female,4,1,583
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,584
Julian Castro,NA,"Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also with criminal penalties. And, you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it's these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade-and-a-half ago.",Candidate,male,4,1,585
Mark Lacey,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,4,1,586
Erin Burnett,NA,"Now to the issue of candidates and their health. Senator Sanders, I want to start with you. We're moving on, Senator. I'm sorry.",Moderator,female,4,1,587
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great, but I would like to respond to that question.",Candidate,male,4,1,588
Erin Burnett,NA,I want to -- I want start by saying...,Moderator,female,4,1,589
Erin Burnett,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,4,1,590
Cory Booker,NA,"And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear, as well.",Candidate,male,4,1,591
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Sanders, this debate does mark your...",Moderator,female,4,1,592
Bernie Sanders,NA,I do. I'm not on it tonight.,Candidate,male,4,1,593
Bernie Sanders,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,594
Erin Burnett,NA,"This debate -- this debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail. Go ahead and finish your point and then I'll ask my question, Senator.",Moderator,female,4,1,595
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I'm more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let's take a deep breath. Take a look at this opioid epidemic.",Candidate,male,4,1,596
Bernie Sanders,NA,"You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies, making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.",Candidate,male,4,1,597
Bernie Sanders,NA,"This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it's not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.",Candidate,male,4,1,598
Erin Burnett,NA,Senator...,Moderator,female,4,1,599
Bernie Sanders,NA,That is why we need a political revolution...,Candidate,male,4,1,600
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,4,1,601
Bernie Sanders,NA,... that says enough is enough to this behavior.,Candidate,male,4,1,602
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,603
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator, we are all very glad you're feeling well...",Moderator,female,4,1,604
Bernie Sanders,NA,Thank you.,Candidate,male,4,1,605
Erin Burnett,NA,"... as you just said. But there is a question on a lot of people's minds, and I want to address it tonight. You're 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency?",Moderator,female,4,1,606
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We're going to have a special guest at that event. And we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.",Candidate,male,4,1,607
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.",Candidate,male,4,1,608
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,609
Erin Burnett,NA,"Vice President Biden, if you're elected, you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can?",Moderator,female,4,1,610
Joe Biden,NA,Because I've watched it. I know what the job is. I've been engaged.,Candidate,male,4,1,611
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.",Candidate,male,4,1,612
Joe Biden,NA,"It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I've done it before. I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there, and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression.",Candidate,male,4,1,613
Joe Biden,NA,"I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.",Candidate,male,4,1,614
Erin Burnett,NA,"Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?",Moderator,female,4,1,615
Joe Biden,NA,Before the first vote.,Candidate,male,4,1,616
Erin Burnett,NA,Before Iowa?,Moderator,female,4,1,617
Joe Biden,NA,Yes.,Candidate,male,4,1,618
Erin Burnett,NA,Not by the end of this year?,Moderator,female,4,1,619
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I've released them before. I released 55 pages of my -- I'm the only guy that's released anything up here.",Candidate,male,4,1,620
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?",Moderator,female,4,1,621
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.",Candidate,female,4,1,622
Elizabeth Warren,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,4,1,623
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, the way I see this, the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.",Candidate,female,4,1,624
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don't want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong.",Candidate,female,4,1,625
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what's broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives, things like childcare and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.",Candidate,female,4,1,626
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Moderator,female,4,1,627
Erin Burnett,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, you're 38 years old, and you would be the youngest president if elected. Should age matter when choosing a president?",Moderator,female,4,1,628
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I'm glad you asked, because I was going to say it's not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the Army and do my best to stay in shape.",Candidate,female,4,1,629
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"But here's the real question I believe you should be asking is: Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like. It highlights how critical it is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who is ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.",Candidate,female,4,1,630
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Bringing the experience that I have, both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee, the experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.",Candidate,female,4,1,631
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.",Candidate,female,4,1,632
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Congresswoman.",Moderator,female,4,1,633
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,I'd like to ask our other candidates this question. I'd like to start with Senator Warren...,Candidate,female,4,1,634
Erin Burnett,NA,"Sorry, Congressman, I'm sorry.",Moderator,female,4,1,635
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,... what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief.,Candidate,female,4,1,636
Erin Burnett,NA,"I'm sorry, thank you. We're going to take another break now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio will be back in just a few moments.",Moderator,female,4,1,637
Erin Burnett,(COMMERCIAL BREAK),NA,Moderator,female,4,1,638
Anderson Cooper,NA,And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. Mark Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Mark?,Moderator,male,4,1,639
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?",Moderator,male,4,1,640
Andrew Yang,NA,"As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move.",Candidate,male,4,1,641
Andrew Yang,NA,"But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true.",Candidate,male,4,1,642
Andrew Yang,NA,"So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.",Candidate,male,4,1,643
Andrew Yang,NA,Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.,Candidate,male,4,1,644
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.",Moderator,male,4,1,645
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place: that's Amazon.",Candidate,female,4,1,646
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.",Candidate,female,4,1,647
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,4,1,648
Mark Lacey,NA,"Mr. Steyer, your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,649
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.",Candidate,male,4,1,650
Tom Steyer,NA,"But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch -- one room, no employers -- and built a multi-billion-dollar international business. We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.",Candidate,male,4,1,651
Tom Steyer,NA,"In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan's a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he's failed the American people, and he has to go.",Candidate,male,4,1,652
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,male,4,1,653
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?",Moderator,male,4,1,654
Cory Booker,NA,"Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy -- we have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.",Candidate,male,4,1,655
Cory Booker,NA,"And antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.",Candidate,male,4,1,656
Cory Booker,NA,"And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact that we -- it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,4,1,657
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,4,1,658
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,4,1,659
Mark Lacey,NA,"Congressman O'Rourke, you say you're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. So what's the proper level of oversight here?",Moderator,male,4,1,660
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Yeah, we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we, the people, have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits.",Candidate,male,4,1,661
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Right now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when, in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.",Candidate,male,4,1,662
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.",Candidate,male,4,1,663
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy, and data, and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.",Candidate,male,4,1,664
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Sanders, your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,665
Bernie Sanders,NA,"When we talk about a rigged economy, it's not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have 10 media companies that control about 90 percent of what the American people see, hear, or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day.",Candidate,male,4,1,666
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,4,1,667
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Harris, to you, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?",Moderator,male,4,1,668
Kamala Harris,NA,"No, I don't agree with that at all. And serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that's -- that's a ridiculous argument he's making.",Candidate,female,4,1,669
Kamala Harris,NA,"But I do want to also say this. What we're talking about is a grave injustice, when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.",Candidate,female,4,1,670
Kamala Harris,NA,"And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.",Candidate,female,4,1,671
Kamala Harris,NA,"Because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.",Candidate,female,4,1,672
Kamala Harris,NA,"We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.",Candidate,female,4,1,673
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,674
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.",Candidate,female,4,1,675
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, join me -- join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.",Candidate,female,4,1,676
Elizabeth Warren,NA,But let's figure -- no. Let's figure out...,Candidate,female,4,1,677
Kamala Harris,NA,No?,Candidate,female,4,1,678
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"... why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech -- you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.",Candidate,female,4,1,679
Kamala Harris,NA,You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.,Candidate,female,4,1,680
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I announced this morning -- I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We've already agreed, Bernie and I, we're not taking any money from big pharma executives.",Candidate,female,4,1,681
Elizabeth Warren,NA,You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices...,Candidate,female,4,1,682
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Harris?",Moderator,male,4,1,683
Elizabeth Warren,NA,... that support us all.,Candidate,female,4,1,684
Kamala Harris,NA,"You -- it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.",Candidate,female,4,1,685
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Yes.,Candidate,female,4,1,686
Kamala Harris,NA,"Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.",Candidate,female,4,1,687
Mark Lacey,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here.",Moderator,male,4,1,688
Mark Lacey,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,4,1,689
Mark Lacey,NA,Your response?,Moderator,male,4,1,690
Kamala Harris,NA,I'm not finished. I'm not finished.,Candidate,female,4,1,691
Kamala Harris,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,female,4,1,692
Kamala Harris,NA,And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.,Candidate,female,4,1,693
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that.",Candidate,female,4,1,694
Kamala Harris,NA,So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?,Candidate,female,4,1,695
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What I do have a problem with is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.",Candidate,female,4,1,696
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here.",Moderator,male,4,1,697
Mark Lacey,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,4,1,698
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom markets. I had a life before government.",Candidate,female,4,1,699
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long distance market. Well, right now we have another gilded age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed.",Candidate,female,4,1,700
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro-competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country.",Candidate,female,4,1,701
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, would you like to weigh in?",Moderator,male,4,1,702
Amy Klobuchar,NA,And this means everything from tech on down.,Candidate,female,4,1,703
Mark Lacey,NA,Please respond.,Moderator,male,4,1,704
Julian Castro,NA,"Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.",Candidate,male,4,1,705
Julian Castro,NA,"And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should, or it's a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices, and that's what I would do as president.",Candidate,male,4,1,706
Mark Lacey,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",Moderator,male,4,1,707
Mark Lacey,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,4,1,708
Andrew Yang,NA,"The best way we can fight back -- the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.",Candidate,male,4,1,709
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang.",Moderator,female,4,1,710
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,There's a bigger issue here...,Candidate,female,4,1,711
Erin Burnett,NA,"Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they're pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them?",Moderator,female,4,1,712
Kamala Harris,NA,"My plan is as -- as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect. That's called pre-clearance.",Candidate,female,4,1,713
Kamala Harris,NA,"Because the reality is that while we still have -- as I said earlier -- these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.",Candidate,female,4,1,714
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,4,1,715
Kamala Harris,NA,"But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen it. I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was, uh, uh, no.",Candidate,female,4,1,716
Kamala Harris,NA,"The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision.",Candidate,female,4,1,717
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,4,1,718
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Harris, thank you.",Moderator,female,4,1,719
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?",Moderator,female,4,1,720
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say, what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew -- you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.",Candidate,female,4,1,721
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country, when over 75 percent of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90 percent of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.",Candidate,female,4,1,722
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator, thank you.",Moderator,female,4,1,723
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond.",Moderator,female,4,1,724
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They're not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country -- liberty, the ability to control your own body -- but they're particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty, because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body.",Candidate,male,4,1,725
Cory Booker,NA,"And so the way as president of the United States I'm going to deal with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House-level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade.",Candidate,male,4,1,726
Cory Booker,NA,"I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment, so that we are leading the Planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.",Candidate,male,4,1,727
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,4,1,728
Erin Burnett,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?",Moderator,female,4,1,729
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.",Candidate,female,4,1,730
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as they're passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.",Candidate,female,4,1,731
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.",Candidate,female,4,1,732
Erin Burnett,NA,Thank you very much.,Moderator,female,4,1,733
Erin Burnett,NA,The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican-appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.,Moderator,female,4,1,734
Erin Burnett,NA,"Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights?",Moderator,female,4,1,735
Joe Biden,NA,"I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.",Candidate,male,4,1,736
Joe Biden,NA,"I want to point out that the justices I've supported, when I defeated Robert Bork -- and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.",Candidate,male,4,1,737
Joe Biden,NA,"The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.",Candidate,male,4,1,738
Joe Biden,NA,"And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that's what I would do. No one would get on the court.",Candidate,male,4,1,739
Joe Biden,NA,"And by the way, if, in fact, at the end of this -- beginning next year, if, in fact, one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.",Candidate,male,4,1,740
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President.",Moderator,female,4,1,741
Erin Burnett,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you have discussed expanding the court from 9 to 15 justices. What's your response to the vice president?",Moderator,female,4,1,742
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values, for example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.",Candidate,male,4,1,743
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court. We can't go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.",Candidate,male,4,1,744
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal and how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.",Candidate,male,4,1,745
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits -- don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else -- to a rotation off the appellate bench.",Candidate,male,4,1,746
Erin Burnett,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,4,1,747
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I'm not wedded to a particular solution, but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one...",Candidate,male,4,1,748
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.",Moderator,female,4,1,749
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"... that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because we can't go on like this.",Candidate,male,4,1,750
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro, he's talking about making the court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?",Moderator,female,4,1,751
Julian Castro,NA,"I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the court. You know, I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe, if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.",Candidate,male,4,1,752
Julian Castro,NA,"I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde amendment, because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her health care needs met.",Candidate,male,4,1,753
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?",Moderator,female,4,1,754
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I think there are a number of options. I think, as Mayor Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them.",Candidate,female,4,1,755
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.",Candidate,female,4,1,756
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14-year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.",Candidate,female,4,1,757
Erin Burnett,NA,"Senator, thank you.",Moderator,female,4,1,758
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We should not leave this to the Supreme Court. We should do it through democracy, because we can.",Candidate,female,4,1,759
Erin Burnett,NA,"Thank you very much, Senator.",Moderator,female,4,1,760
Anderson Cooper,NA,"As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.",Moderator,male,4,1,761
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?",Moderator,male,4,1,762
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done, and if you can get it done.",Candidate,male,4,1,763
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us -- putting us in a position where I was able to end roe -- excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons.",Candidate,male,4,1,764
Joe Biden,NA,"And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you're going to do it, and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.",Candidate,male,4,1,765
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Just to clarify, Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?",Moderator,male,4,1,766
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, the senator said -- she's being vague on the issue of -- actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here's the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion -- it's more than the entire federal budget -- let me finish, OK?",Candidate,male,4,1,767
Anderson Cooper,NA,You'll both get in.,Moderator,male,4,1,768
Joe Biden,NA,"If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you -- it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?",Candidate,male,4,1,769
Bernie Sanders,NA,Two things. Let me explain in two ways.,Candidate,male,4,1,770
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Sanders, respond.",Moderator,male,4,1,771
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.",Candidate,male,4,1,772
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.",Candidate,male,4,1,773
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,4,1,774
Bernie Sanders,NA,"If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.",Candidate,male,4,1,775
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Vice President Biden, you can respond, and then Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,4,1,776
Joe Biden,NA,We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a public option.,Candidate,male,4,1,777
Bernie Sanders,NA,No.,Candidate,male,4,1,778
Joe Biden,NA,We can.,Candidate,male,4,1,779
Bernie Sanders,NA,"No, you can't.",Candidate,male,4,1,780
Joe Biden,NA,And we can afford to do it.,Candidate,male,4,1,781
Bernie Sanders,NA,You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the health care industry.,Candidate,male,4,1,782
Joe Biden,NA,"By the way, the greed and...",Candidate,male,4,1,783
Anderson Cooper,NA,Let him respond. Mr. Vice President?,Moderator,male,4,1,784
Joe Biden,NA,"The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. And it's going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance, and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it.",Candidate,male,4,1,785
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Warren, your response?",Moderator,male,4,1,786
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed.",Candidate,female,4,1,787
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated.",Candidate,female,4,1,788
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money...",Candidate,female,4,1,789

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.",Candidate,male,4,1,810
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We're being offered a false choice. I don't agree with the vice president that Trump is an aberration. I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal. Because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn't work. That's part of how we got here. That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.",Candidate,male,4,1,811
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight -- absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it's going to take more than fighting. Once again, I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime -- Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s, an assault weapons ban, which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students.",Candidate,male,4,1,812
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn't count unless we go even further, free college for low- and middle-income students isn't good enough unless we're also paying for the children of billionaires.

Beto O'Rourke,NA,"So we set about turning around the V.A., hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men who had put their lives on the line for this country.

Anderson Cooper,NA,"Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's OK that we're all different.",Moderator,male,4,1,849

Julian Castro,NA,"Well, first of all, thank you to Marc, thank you, Anderson, and thank you, Erin, and CNN, and New York Times and everybody who is here tonight.",Candidate,male,4,1,852
Julian Castro,NA,"You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I've had have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me, or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers, as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.",Candidate,male,4,1,853
Julian Castro,NA,"And sometimes also -- and this goes to the heart of your question, I think -- people who thought differently from me, folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there's a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.",Candidate,male,4,1,854
Julian Castro,NA,"I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.",Candidate,male,4,1,855
Julian Castro,NA,"I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions.",Candidate,male,4,1,856
Julian Castro,NA,"And there are people, whether it's our former president, George W. Bush, or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn't be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they've done.",Candidate,male,4,1,857

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Thank you. You know, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with ""aloha."" It's not a word that means hello and goodbye.

It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we're all connected, we're all brothers and sisters, we're all God's children.",Candidate,female,4,1,859
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially, with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example.

And he's been there for me during some personally challenging times.",Candidate,female,4,1,860
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.",Candidate,female,4,1,861
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect, even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation.",Candidate,female,4,1,862
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country. You can visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.",Candidate,female,4,1,863

Anderson Cooper,NA,Senator Klobuchar?,Moderator,male,4,1,865
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"For me, it's John McCain, and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him. And he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders, and they would look away from me, he'd say, ""Senator Klobuchar is the lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.""",Candidate,female,4,1,866
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this: ""There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.""",Candidate,female,4,1,867
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That's what we're doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win -- and not just win the presidency, but take back the U.S. Senate -- is by winning big.",Candidate,female,4,1,868
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base that's out there today, but it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this. And I ask you to join me because I've done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.",Candidate,female,4,1,869

Anderson Cooper,NA,"Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.",Moderator,male,4,1,872
Tom Steyer,NA,"So I'm friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who's fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She's a different gender. She's a different race. She's from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor.",Candidate,male,4,1,873
Tom Steyer,NA,"My mother was a schoolteacher in the New York Public Schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, when you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.",Candidate,male,4,1,874
Tom Steyer,NA,"And that's why I started the Need to Impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully, and that's why I'm running for the president, because our government has failed, it's been bought by corporations, and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people.",Candidate,male,4,1,875
Tom Steyer,NA,"I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.",Candidate,male,4,1,876

Anderson Cooper,NA,Congressman O'Rourke?,Moderator,male,4,1,879
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"I've always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges, regardless of the differences. I did that as a small-business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas.",Candidate,male,4,1,880
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"Did it as a member of the City Council, where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community.",Candidate,male,4,1,881
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio. I was visiting the V.A. there, March of 2017. Found that my flight had been snowed in, in Washington, D.C. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd. And on a whim, I said, do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?",Candidate,male,4,1,882
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot. It was spring break. Drove 1,600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.",Candidate,male,4,1,883
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other's bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue.",Candidate,male,4,1,884
Beto O'Rourke,NA,"And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat. We won independents and Republicans in record numbers, as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.",Candidate,male,4,1,885
Anderson Cooper,NA,"Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendship.",Moderator,male,4,1,886
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, look, I have so many, I don't even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor. He and I had to form a friendship, even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendships across the aisle.",Candidate,male,4,1,887
Cory Booker,NA,"I go to Bible study in Chairman Inhofe's office. He and I pass legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner at a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I'm a vegan, and he's a meat-eating Texan.",Candidate,male,4,1,888
Cory Booker,NA,"But I'll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test. The spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history. Rugged individualism didn't get us to the Moon. It didn't beat the Nazis. It didn't map the human genome. It didn't beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country big.",Candidate,male,4,1,889
Cory Booker,NA,"And, Vice President, we have done so many big things. The fact that there's an openly gay man, a black woman, all of us on the stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.",Candidate,male,4,1,890
Cory Booker,NA,"This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic of grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.",Candidate,male,4,1,891
Cory Booker,NA,"And love is not sentimentality. It's not anemic. Love is struggle. Love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we're ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other...",Candidate,male,4,1,892

Andrew Yang,NA,"My surprising friendship, it's been so much fun running for president, because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who's an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.",Candidate,male,4,1,901
Andrew Yang,NA,"And I'm happy to say that, after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we remained in touch ever since.",Candidate,male,4,1,902
Andrew Yang,NA,"The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white-collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party.",Candidate,male,4,1,903
Andrew Yang,NA,"Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016. What did he say? He said we're going to build a wall, we're going to turn the clock back, we're going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward. And that is where we must take the country in 2020.",Candidate,male,4,1,904

Anderson Cooper,NA,"Mr. Yang, thank you very much. Senator Harris?",Moderator,male,4,1,906
Kamala Harris,NA,"Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I -- actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agree on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, ""Kamala, you know, Appalachia loves this."" And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.",Candidate,female,4,1,907
Kamala Harris,NA,"And I guess that's why I'm running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country, we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.",Candidate,female,4,1,908
Kamala Harris,NA,"And I'll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone. And she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer. And so she arrived in California. She got -- you know, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement, she met my father, and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended.",Candidate,female,4,1,909
Kamala Harris,NA,"But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney general of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate, and I will tell you, that's part of why I'm running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideas will always hold true.",Candidate,female,4,1,910
Kamala Harris,NA,And so that's what is at stake in this election. And I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.,Candidate,female,4,1,911

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives.",Candidate,male,4,1,914
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn't care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other.",Candidate,male,4,1,915
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I'll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you can go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.",Candidate,male,4,1,916
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that's what friendship and that's what service can create. And I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair.",Candidate,male,4,1,917
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people. And I'm asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.",Candidate,male,4,1,918

Anderson Cooper,NA,"Mr. Mayor, thank you. Senator Sanders?",Moderator,male,4,1,920
Bernie Sanders,NA,"When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history. And I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate. So we had to go back to the drawing board.",Candidate,male,4,1,921
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I worked with John McCain. I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration.",Candidate,male,4,1,922
Bernie Sanders,NA,"More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get U.S. -- get the votes to get the U.S. troops out of that area.",Candidate,male,4,1,923
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But I think, at the end of day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion.",Candidate,male,4,1,924
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.",Candidate,male,4,1,925

Elizabeth Warren,NA,And we didn't agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was. But he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.,Candidate,female,4,1,929
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three elder brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we're divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together.",Candidate,female,4,1,930
Elizabeth Warren,NA,We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in.,Candidate,female,4,1,931
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, people across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what's broken. They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.",Candidate,female,4,1,932
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more, we want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight.",Candidate,female,4,1,933

Joe Biden,NA,"This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.",Candidate,male,4,1,938
Joe Biden,NA,"The two people maybe would surprise you the most were -- he's been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was -- he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.",Candidate,male,4,1,939
Joe Biden,NA,"And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, ""John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight."" And he'd say, ""You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve."" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.",Candidate,male,4,1,940
Joe Biden,NA,"And one of the things -- that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.",Candidate,male,4,1,941
Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.",Candidate,male,4,1,942
Joe Biden,NA,"And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for god's sake, get up. Get up and remember, there is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing we're unable to do when we decide we're going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.",Candidate,male,4,1,943

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Hello, and welcome to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic maandidates debate. At least some of us are very, very happy to be here tonight. I'm Rachel Maddow here in Atlanta, Georgia, tonight with my fellow moderators. Andrea Mitchell is NBC news foreign affairs correspondent and the host of ""Andrea Mitchell Reports"" on MSNBC. Ashley Parker is White House reporter for the Washington Post. And Kristen Welker is NBC News White House correspondent.",Moderator,female,5,1,5
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"We'll be covering a wide range of topics tonight, including national security, race, and climate. Each candidate will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer our questions and 45 seconds if we need to follow up. And we ask the audience to respect the candidates and please don't interrupt.",Moderator,female,5,1,6
Rachel Maddow,NA,There's 10 candidates here tonight. No time to waste. Let's get right to it.,Moderator,female,5,1,7
Rachel Maddow,NA,We're in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nation's history. Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically.,Moderator,female,5,1,8
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Warren, you have said already that you've seen enough to convict the president and remove him from office. You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also U.S. senators may soon have to take that vote. Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?",Moderator,female,5,1,9
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And that's what's happened with Ukraine.",Candidate,female,5,1,10
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We have to establish the principle: no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.",Candidate,female,5,1,11
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But I want to add one more part based on today's testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what's happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington.",Candidate,female,5,1,12
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they're going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I've taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don't ask to be an ambassador, because I'm not going to have that happen.",Candidate,female,5,1,13
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I asked everyone who's running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.,Candidate,female,5,1,14
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,15
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you've said that you support the impeachment inquiry but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president. After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?",Moderator,female,5,1,16
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct and I've called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision.,Candidate,female,5,1,17
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country's interest, and this is wrong.",Candidate,female,5,1,18
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"This is a pattern with this man. And it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day. That is what this guy does.",Candidate,female,5,1,19
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that's going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum. And on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect. And he said this: We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a president of the United States.",Candidate,female,5,1,20
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator, thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,21
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Sanders, I'd like to go to you. Americans are watching these impeachment hearings. At the same time, they're also focused on their more immediate, daily economic and family concerns. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?",Moderator,female,5,1,22
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election.",Candidate,male,5,1,23
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Right now, you've got 87 million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured. We're facing the great existential crisis of our time in terms of climate change. You've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street and you've got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing.",Candidate,male,5,1,24
Bernie Sanders,NA,"What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump's corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.",Candidate,male,5,1,25
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, let me put the same question to you. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by the impeachment inquiry be to a Democratic nominee's campaign? How central would it be to yours?",Moderator,female,5,1,26
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics. And it is not a part of the campaign. But the president's conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that we're learning more about in the investigations -- but just to be clear, the president's already confessed to it on television. But that's just part of what we've seen.",Candidate,male,5,1,27
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we're also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end one way or the other.",Candidate,male,5,1,28
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I'm running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever and, while doing it, address big issues that didn't take a vacation for the impeachment process or for the Trump presidency as a whole: a climate approaching the point of no return, the fact we've still got to act on health care, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold on to what they've got.",Candidate,male,5,1,29
Rachel Maddow,NA,Mr. Mayor.,Moderator,female,5,1,30
Pete Buttigieg,NA,Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president and will be at the heart of our campaign.,Candidate,male,5,1,31
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Mr. Mayor, thank you. Andrea?",Moderator,female,5,1,32
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Vice President Biden, you've suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again. But right now, Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you've worked with for decades, are demanding investigations not only of you but also of your son. How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?",Moderator,female,5,1,33
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, look, the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, that's number one. And, number two, going to have to be able make be -- be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That's what I'll do.",Candidate,male,5,1,34
Joe Biden,NA,"You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place? And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?",Candidate,male,5,1,35
Joe Biden,NA,"And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned, number one, that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that -- while at the same time innocent people in the Donbas are getting killed by Russian soldiers.",Candidate,male,5,1,36
Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be president. So I -- I've learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that -- that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question: Who is most likely to do what needs to be done, produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?",Candidate,male,5,1,37
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?",Moderator,female,5,1,38
Kamala Harris,NA,"Well, first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House. And there is no question that in 2020 the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.",Candidate,female,5,1,39
Kamala Harris,NA,"And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president, from what we heard today, the vice president, the secretary of state, and the chief of staff.",Candidate,female,5,1,40
Kamala Harris,NA,"And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue, and back to the question that you asked earlier, which is, what does this mean for the American people?",Candidate,female,5,1,41
Kamala Harris,NA,"Because what it means, when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America: the powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else.",Candidate,female,5,1,42
Kamala Harris,NA,"Because here's the thing. For those working people who are working two or three jobs, if they don't pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don't pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody. And part of the reason I'm running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people, and not just for some.",Candidate,female,5,1,43
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,5,1,44
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter. If you were elected, though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump presidency, among other things. Do you see that divide as permanent? Or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?",Moderator,female,5,1,45
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks.",Candidate,female,5,1,46
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50 billion in assets, your first $50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, you've got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you've got to pinch in a few pennies more.",Candidate,female,5,1,47
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Here's the thing. Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It's about saying, you built something great in this country? Good for you. But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it using -- you're getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.",Candidate,female,5,1,48
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one tenth of one percent big, pitch in two cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it.",Candidate,female,5,1,49
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And here's the thing. That's something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about, because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and say we're going to make real change.",Candidate,female,5,1,50
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,51
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?",Moderator,female,5,1,52
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats. And I don't agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue.",Candidate,male,5,1,53
Cory Booker,NA,"But here's the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well.",Candidate,male,5,1,54
Cory Booker,NA,"When I stood in church recently and asked folks in a black church how many people here want to be entrepreneurs, half the church raised their hands. If we as a country don't start -- if we as a party don't start talking not just about how to tax wealth, but how to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream -- because, yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour.",Candidate,male,5,1,55
Cory Booker,NA,"But the people in communities I frequent, they're not -- aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity. And that's what our party has to be about, as well.",Candidate,male,5,1,56
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?",Moderator,female,5,1,57
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country, and we can provide universal child care for every baby in this country ages zero to five. That is transformative.",Candidate,female,5,1,58
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women, who do this work. And we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre-schoolteacher in America.",Candidate,female,5,1,59
Elizabeth Warren,NA,We can put $800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who've got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation's future.,Candidate,female,5,1,60
Andrea Mitchell,NA,All right. Let me let Senator Booker respond.,Moderator,female,5,1,61
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Sure.,Candidate,female,5,1,62
Cory Booker,NA,"You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We're all united in wanting to see universal preschool. And I'll fight for that. We're all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for two parents that went to HBCUs.",Candidate,male,5,1,63
Cory Booker,NA,"But the tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry, it's cumbersome. It's been tried by other nations. It's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation.",Candidate,male,5,1,64
Cory Booker,NA,"But, again, we as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it. Look at VC dollars in this country. Seventy-five percent of them go to three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas.",Candidate,male,5,1,65
Cory Booker,NA,"If I am president of the United States, we're going to have a fair, just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but, dear God, we're going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. We're going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country.",Candidate,male,5,1,66
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,5,1,67
Cory Booker,NA,We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.,Candidate,male,5,1,68
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this.",Moderator,female,5,1,69
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I just -- the idea behind what is fair, today, the 99 percent in America are on track to pay about 7.2 percent of their total wealth in taxes.",Candidate,female,5,1,70
Cory Booker,NA,I'm not disagreeing with that.,Candidate,male,5,1,71
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"The top one-tenth of one percent that I want to say pay two cents more, they'll pay 3.2 percent in America. I'm tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it's time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets a real...",Candidate,female,5,1,72

Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Thank you very much, Senator Warren. Thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,78
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you have said, quote, ""I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point."" The Republican Party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office. So what would you do that President Obama didn't do to change that?",Moderator,female,5,1,79
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we're in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn't exist in the same way even a few years ago.",Candidate,male,5,1,80
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing, if we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on health care, the reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal health care is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around, creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not.",Candidate,male,5,1,81
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years, as Senator Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.",Candidate,male,5,1,82
Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",Moderator,female,5,1,83
Andrea Mitchell,NA,Kristen Welker?,Moderator,female,5,1,84
Kristen Welker,NA,"Let's talk about Medicare for all. Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all. Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care: protecting Obamacare. Democrats are divided on this issue. What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general election?",Moderator,female,5,1,85
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can't afford it, people who didn't take the tests the doctor recommended because they just can't afford it.",Candidate,female,5,1,86
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So here is my plan. Let's bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can as fast as we can. On day one as president, I will do -- bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. That's going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people. I'm going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration.",Candidate,female,5,1,87
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And in the first 100 days, I want to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000. I want to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and long-term care.",Candidate,female,5,1,88

Bernie Sanders,NA,Yes.,Candidate,male,5,1,95
Kristen Welker,NA,"President Obama explicitly said the country is, quote, ""less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,"" end quote. Is President Obama wrong?",Moderator,female,5,1,96
Bernie Sanders,NA,"No, he's right. We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current health care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional.",Candidate,male,5,1,97
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we've got 87 million uninsured, underinsured. In some cases, we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada or other countries. Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related issues. They come down with cancer, and that's a reason to go bankrupt?",Candidate,male,5,1,98
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR and if you think back to JFK and Harry Truman and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about health care for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time.",Candidate,male,5,1,99
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all. Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses. That's where we've got to go.",Candidate,male,5,1,100
Kristen Welker,NA,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden?",Moderator,female,5,1,101
Joe Biden,NA,"You know, we can do this without charging people -- raising $30 trillion, $40 trillion. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all.",Candidate,male,5,1,102
Bernie Sanders,NA,Not true.,Candidate,male,5,1,103
Joe Biden,NA,It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn't think it makes sense.,Candidate,male,5,1,104
Joe Biden,NA,"We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose, I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. A hundred and sixty million people like their private insurance. And if they don't like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board.",Candidate,male,5,1,105
Joe Biden,NA,"But here's the deal, they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them what the insurance companies -- they want no -- no competition.

A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who are calling for an end to this ongoing Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm's way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security and have cost us thousands of American lives.",Candidate,female,5,1,111
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"These are wars that have cost us as American taxpayers trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs.

Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, let's talk about your record as a candidate. You were elected mayor in a Democratic city receiving just under 11,000 votes. And in your only statewide race, you lost by 25 points. Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?",Moderator,female,5,1,163
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump. I get that it's not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now.",Candidate,male,5,1,164
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to. I don't talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don't even golf.",Candidate,male,5,1,165

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"As a matter of fact, I never thought I'd be on a Forbes magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage.",Candidate,male,5,1,167
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I also wore the uniform of this country and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room. And I know how to bring people together to get things done. I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small. The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.",Candidate,male,5,1,168
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I believe we need to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government, recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best-run communities in the heartland before the other way around starts to happen.",Candidate,male,5,1,169

Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you've said this of Mayor Buttigieg, quote, ""Of the women on the stage, do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard."" Senator, what did you mean by that?",Moderator,female,5,1,171
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"First of all, I've made very clear I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage, and I am honored to be standing next to him. But what I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise, we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can't do, because it has all been men.",Candidate,female,5,1,172
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,173
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And including all vice presidents being men. And I think any working woman out there, any woman that's at home knows exactly what I mean. We have to work harder, and that's a fact.",Candidate,female,5,1,174
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But I want to dispel one thing, because for so long why has this been happening? I don't think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president. I don't think you have to be the skinniest person. I don't think you have the loudest voice on this stage. I don't think that means that you will be the one that should be president. I think what matters is if you're smart, if you're competent, and if you get things done.",Candidate,female,5,1,175
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you've got to win. And I am the one, Mr. Vice President, that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as a lead on a ticket every time. I govern both with my head and my heart. And if you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.",Candidate,female,5,1,176

Joe Biden,NA,"I think a woman is qualified to be president, and there's no reason why -- if you think the woman is the most qualified person now, you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is, number one, I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate, I've passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to dealing with Milosevic, the whole range of things that I've been engaged in my whole career.",Candidate,male,5,1,179
Joe Biden,NA,"I've done it. I've brought people together. I'm always told by everybody around here things have changed, you can't do that anymore. If we can't -- I thought the question was initially asked of the senator, how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly.",Candidate,male,5,1,180
Joe Biden,NA,"And lastly, to be commander-in-chief, there's no time for on-the-job training. I've spent more time in the Situation Room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here.

Ashley Parker,NA,"Senator Booker, one of the defining characters of the Trump presidency is that the American people hear from him directly all the time about everything, on Twitter and just about everywhere else. Setting aside your views of his tone, is that unfiltered communication something you as president would continue? Is this one of the norms broken by President Trump that needed to change?",Moderator,female,5,1,185
Cory Booker,NA,"So, look, this president has broken norms, as you've said. He used his platforms to demean, degrade, and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation.",Candidate,male,5,1,186
Cory Booker,NA,"So, absolutely, in that office I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But it's not for a Kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together. So, absolutely.",Candidate,male,5,1,187

Cory Booker,NA,"And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal.

The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn't be done.",Candidate,male,5,1,190
Cory Booker,NA,"When I am president of the United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed.

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Chants of ""Lock Her Up"" are still heard at President Trump's rallies today. Now some opponents of the president are turning the same slogan against him. They've chanted ""Lock Him Up"" at a recent World Series game in Washington and at a Veterans Day event in New York and, Senator Sanders, at at least two of your campaign events recently. Senator, should Democrats discourage this? Or are you OK with it?",Moderator,female,5,1,194
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law. And what the American people are saying: Nobody is above the law. And I think what the American people are also saying is, in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law.",Candidate,male,5,1,195
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote -- that somebody raised here was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that.",Candidate,male,5,1,196
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real, they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy sufficiency and sustainable energy.",Candidate,male,5,1,197
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Even on issues like guns, the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence. So I believe, yeah, we've got to deal with Trump, but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn't just go to the people on top but to all of us.",Candidate,male,5,1,198
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Vice President Biden, let me ask you to pick up on the issue that Senator Sanders just raised about no one being above the law. When President Ford pardoned President Nixon, he said it was to heal the country. Would you support a potential criminal investigation into President Trump after he leaves office, even if you thought it might further inflame the country's divisions?",Moderator,female,5,1,199
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I'd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. That's not the role of the president of the United States. It's the attorney general of the United States, not the president's attorney, private attorney.",Candidate,male,5,1,200
Joe Biden,NA,"And so I would -- whatever was determined by the attorney general I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be, in fact, criminally prosecuted, then so be it. But I would not direct it.",Candidate,male,5,1,201
Joe Biden,NA,"And I don't think it's a good idea that we mock -- that we model ourselves after Trump and say lock him up. Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people and treating -- you know, the next president starts tweeting should -- anyway.",Candidate,male,5,1,202
Joe Biden,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,203
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, it's just -- look, it's about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country. And that's not who we are, that's not who we've been, that's not who we should be. Follow the law, let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.",Candidate,male,5,1,204
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Sanders, let me ask you briefly to respond to that, the difference of opinion there with Vice President Biden.",Moderator,female,5,1,205
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, I think Joe is right. I think that it is the function of the attorney general. But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he's above the law. We have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who's violated the emoluments clause.",Candidate,male,5,1,206
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I think Joe is right, that is the function of an independent Department of Justice. But my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.",Candidate,male,5,1,207
Joe Biden,NA,Can I respond very quickly?,Candidate,male,5,1,208
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Briefly, Senator.",Moderator,female,5,1,209
Joe Biden,NA,"Distinction, should he be impeached and should he be thrown out of office? That's one question. He's very close to -- he's indicted himself. Number two, after he's thrown out of office or after he's defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That's a judgment to be made by an attorney general.",Candidate,male,5,1,210

Ashley Parker,NA,"We now focus on an issue facing many Americans, childcare and paid family leave. Here in Georgia, the average price of infant daycare can be as much as $8,500 per child per year. That's more than instate tuition at a four-year public college in Georgia. Mr. Yang, what would you do as president to ease that financial burden?",Moderator,female,5,1,213
Andrew Yang,NA,"There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list. And we need to get off this list as soon as possible.",Candidate,male,5,1,214
Andrew Yang,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,215
Andrew Yang,NA,"I would pass paid family leave as one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs, and it's breaking families' backs. We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning, because by the time they're showing up to pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, they're already years behind.",Candidate,male,5,1,216
Andrew Yang,NA,"Studies have shown that two-thirds of our kids' educational outcomes are determined by what's happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words read to them as children, type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them.",Candidate,male,5,1,217
Andrew Yang,NA,"So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1,000 a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases $2,000 a month into families' pockets, so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child. We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that tradeoff and say if they leave the home and work, they're going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway. In many cases, it would be better if the parent stays home with the child.",Candidate,male,5,1,218

Ashley Parker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,5,1,220
Ashley Parker,NA,"Sticking with this topic, no parent in the United States is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby. A number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this. Senator Harris, you're one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave. And Senator Klobuchar, you're one of the candidates proposing up to three months. I want to hear from both of you on this, starting with you, Senator Klobuchar. Why three months?",Moderator,female,5,1,221
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I've looked at this economically, and I want to make sure that we help people. Because as just pointed out, we are way behind the curve, our country is, when it comes to providing paid family leave and childcare. We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big.",Candidate,female,5,1,222
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But what I have done with all of my plans is I have shown how I'm going to pay for them meticulously. I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the White House right now one who has told over 10,000 lies.",Candidate,female,5,1,223
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So when you look at my website, at amyklobuchar.com, you will see my plans and you're also going to see how I'm going to pay for it. And I think that is so important, because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino, and really putting this country in a worst financial situation every single day.",Candidate,female,5,1,224
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So, yes, my plan is three months. I think that's good. I'd love to do more. As I've said before, I'd love to staple free diplomas under people's chairs. I just am not going to go for things -- and this is not -- I'm talking about Senator Harris' plan here, but I'm talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.",Candidate,female,5,1,225
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think that we have an obligation -- we have an obligation as a party to be, yes, fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but make sure we have people's backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for. And that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don't support, to kicking 149 million off their health insurance -- current health insurance in four years.",Candidate,female,5,1,226
Ashley Parker,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,227
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I just think we have to be smart about how we do this.,Candidate,female,5,1,228
Ashley Parker,NA,"Thank you, Senator. And, Senator Harris, why six months? And also, how would you pay for that?",Moderator,female,5,1,229
Kamala Harris,NA,"Sure. And, everybody, please visit my website, kamalaharris.org, for the details on everything I talk about. Six months, so part of how I believe we're going to win this election is, it is going to be because we are focused on the future, we are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.",Candidate,female,5,1,230
Kamala Harris,NA,"So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare to all of the activities that are required, much less the health care needs that are required.",Candidate,female,5,1,231
Kamala Harris,NA,"And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today.",Candidate,female,5,1,232
Kamala Harris,NA,"The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, but fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.",Candidate,female,5,1,233
Ashley Parker,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,5,1,234
Kamala Harris,NA,"So my policy is about -- there's a whole collection of the work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.",Candidate,female,5,1,235

It is particularly acute in your home state of California, in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Why are you the best person to fix this problem?",Moderator,female,5,1,238
Tom Steyer,NA,"When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school. It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work.",Candidate,male,5,1,239
Tom Steyer,NA,"What we've seen in California is, as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units. And that affects everybody in California. It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents which affect every single working person in the state of California.",Candidate,male,5,1,240
Tom Steyer,NA,"I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units.",Candidate,male,5,1,241
Tom Steyer,NA,"But the other thing that's going to be true about building these units is, we're going to have to build them in a way that's sustainable, that, in fact, how we build units, where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability.",Candidate,male,5,1,242
Tom Steyer,NA,"So we are going to have to direct dollars, we're going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who have worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we're going to have force it, and then we're going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50 percent of their income on rent.",Candidate,male,5,1,243
Kristen Welker,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Warren, I see your hand raised.",Moderator,female,5,1,244
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side, and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing.",Candidate,female,5,1,245
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Also, private developers, they've gone up to McMansions. They're not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers.",Candidate,female,5,1,246
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I've got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It's about tenants' rights.",Candidate,female,5,1,247
Elizabeth Warren,NA,But there's one more piece. Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people you're cut out of the deal. That was known as red-lining.,Candidate,female,5,1,248
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"When I built a housing plan, it's not only a housing plan about building new units. It's a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government-sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it, and we need to say we're going to reverse it.",Candidate,female,5,1,249

Cory Booker,NA,"I'm so grateful, again, as a mayor who was a mayor during a recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis, who started my career as a tenants' rights lawyer, these are all good points, but we're not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low-income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation.",Candidate,male,5,1,252
Cory Booker,NA,"And so all these things we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we've got to start empowering people. We use our tax code to move wealth up, the mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying and the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners.",Candidate,male,5,1,253
Cory Booker,NA,"And what that does is it actually slashes poverty, 10 million people out. And by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord, it is also low-income families struggling to stay in their homes.",Candidate,male,5,1,254

Rachel Maddow,NA,American farmers are struggling under the effects of President Trump's trade war with China. The Trump administration's payments to farmers to offset those losses already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the Obama administration's auto bailout.,Moderator,female,5,1,260
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, would you continue those farm subsidies?",Moderator,female,5,1,261
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We shouldn't have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn't have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago, I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.",Candidate,male,5,1,262
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"By the way, this isn't even making farmers whole. If you're in soybeans, for example, you're getting killed. And it's not just what this president has done with the trade war. In a lot of parts of the country, the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who are involved in ethanol.",Candidate,male,5,1,263
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Look, I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more I'm talking to people in rural America who see that they're not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.",Candidate,male,5,1,264
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them, not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to.",Candidate,male,5,1,265
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change. I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And it's an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging they're part of the problem.",Candidate,male,5,1,266
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to answer the question. Would you continue those subsidies or not?",Moderator,female,5,1,267

Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue. This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face. These are the kinds of conversations that we're having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together, saying, hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we're able to raise our kids in a community that's safe.",Candidate,female,5,1,273
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry, instead investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the 21st century with good-paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure, and transitioning our agriculture -- that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face -- towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and well-being of our people, leading as a -- as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.",Candidate,female,5,1,274
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman. I want to bring in Mr. Steyer on this. You've made climate change a central point of your political career.

Tom Steyer,NA,"Rachel, I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number-one priority for me. Vice President Biden won't say it. Senator Warren won't say it. It's a state of emergency, and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency.",Candidate,male,5,1,276
Tom Steyer,NA,"I know that we have to do this. I've spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this.",Candidate,male,5,1,277
Tom Steyer,NA,"I would make this the number-one priority of my foreign policy, as well. We can do this and create literally millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low-income black and brown communities. And when we ask, how are we going to pull this country together, how about this: We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world, and we do it together. Do you think that would pull America together? I do.",Candidate,male,5,1,278
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Quickly, Vice President Biden, you were name-checked there. I'd like to give you a chance to respond.",Moderator,female,5,1,279
Joe Biden,NA,"Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It's the number-one issue. And I might add, I don't really need a kind of a lecture from -- from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a game-changer, while I managed the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we've ever done it, my friend was introducing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world, according to the press, than all of Great Britain produces.",Candidate,male,5,1,280
Joe Biden,NA,"Now, he's -- I welcome him back into the fold here, and he's been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let's get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of all time.",Candidate,male,5,1,281

Tom Steyer,NA,"Can I respond to that, Rachel?",Candidate,male,5,1,283
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You may respond, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,5,1,284
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and it was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels. And we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago.",Candidate,male,5,1,285
Tom Steyer,NA,"If we're waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills -- and I know everybody on this stage cares about this. But Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever. This is a problem which continues to get worse. That's why I'm saying it's a state of emergency. That's why I'm saying it's priority one. If it isn't priority one, it's not going to get done.",Candidate,male,5,1,286
Tom Steyer,NA,"And this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront. We have to make it the most important thing. And we can use it to rebuild and reimagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water and create millions of good-paying jobs.",Candidate,male,5,1,287

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question, because your question has said, what are we going to do in decades? We don't have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we're talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.",Candidate,male,5,1,293

Bernie Sanders,NA,"What we have got to do tonight, and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.

Andrea Mitchell,NA,"Senator Harris, North Korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits if President Trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons. If you were commander-in-chief, would you make concessions to Kim Jong-un in order to keep those talks going?",Moderator,female,5,1,300
Kamala Harris,NA,"With all due deference to the fact that this is presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked.

Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,302
Kamala Harris,NA,"And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation -- and therefore, an extension of our ability to be secure -- is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.",Candidate,female,5,1,303
Kamala Harris,NA,"What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.",Candidate,female,5,1,304
Andrea Mitchell,NA,But would you make concessions to North Korea to keep talks...,Moderator,female,5,1,305
Kamala Harris,NA,"Not at this point. There are no concessions to be made. They -- he has traded a photo-op for nothing. He has abandoned the -- by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year-and-a-half, so those operations, which should be -- and those exercises, which should be active, because they are in our best national security, the relationship that we have with Japan, he has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea's nuclear program.",Candidate,female,5,1,306

Joe Biden,NA,"Well, first of all, I'd go back in making sure we had the alliances we had before since he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong-un, who's a thug -- although he points out that I'm a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick, very recently was his comment.",Candidate,male,5,1,309

And the way we do that is, we make clear to China, which I have done personally with -- with the president of China, and that is we're going to move up our defenses, we're going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea, and if they view that as a threat, it's an easy thing to respond to. They, in fact, can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea.",Candidate,male,5,1,313
Joe Biden,NA,"But the fact is that we're in a position where he has done this across the world. He's embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is -- his whole effort is to break up NATO, to increase his power. Look what he's done to -- and so this guy has no idea what he's doing. He has no notion how to go about it.

Many of the demonstrators are asking the United States for help. If you were president, would the U.S. help their movement, and how?",Moderator,female,5,1,338
Cory Booker,NA,"Well, first of all, this is president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and, in fact, attacking them, as well. We used a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. And so at the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer, and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies we would need to show strength against China.",Candidate,male,5,1,339
Cory Booker,NA,"There's a larger battle going on, on the planet Earth right now between totalitarian, dictatorial countries and free democracies. And we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government, with its leader now getting rid of even his -- getting rid of term limits.",Candidate,male,5,1,340
Cory Booker,NA,"And so I believe we need a much stronger policy, one that's not led, as President Trump seems to want to do, in a transactional way, but one that's led by American values. So, yes, we will call China out for its human rights violations.",Candidate,male,5,1,341
Cory Booker,NA,"But not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights. Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. It's a human right violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization for the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with and begin to check China, check Putin, and the other folks that are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.",Candidate,male,5,1,342

Joe Biden,NA,"Yes, and I said it at the time. Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them, we were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. There's very little social redeeming value of the -- in the present government in Saudi Arabia.",Candidate,male,5,1,345

Joe Biden,NA,"And with regard to China, we should -- look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China, what they're doing with the million Uighurs that are there, essentially in concentration camps in the west.

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said, first of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene, but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating, even though they were cheating, for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty.",Candidate,female,5,1,351

Kristen Welker,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, to you. As president, would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing?",Moderator,female,5,1,377
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness, and attacks that unfortunately have taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It's important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.",Candidate,female,5,1,378
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"This is something that I'll do as president and commander-in-chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs, end the money bail system, enact the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.",Candidate,female,5,1,379
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, orientation, and our politics.

Andrew Yang,NA,I talked to an anti-hate activist named Christian Picciolini who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10-year period.

Now he's out and he's helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society.,Candidate,male,5,1,385
Andrew Yang,NA,"But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken 14-year-old boy, he would have gone with them. He said if it had been a coach, I would have gone with him, if it had been a mentor or a teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.",Candidate,male,5,1,386
Andrew Yang,NA,"So what we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 percent-plus of the shooters we're talking about are young boys and young men. We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in today's economy.",Candidate,male,5,1,387

Joe Biden,NA,"The fact is that what happens now is that we, in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated.

Joe Biden,NA,"We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with -- I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25, and found out I said, what do you need -- what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and on your schools? You know what they said? Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.",Candidate,male,5,1,392
Joe Biden,NA,"And that's when we started this movement on the college campuses to fundamentally change the culture. No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, other than in self-defense, and that's -- rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. It will be a big -- no, I really mean it. It's a gigantic issue.

Kamala Harris,NA,Because when black women...,Candidate,female,5,1,399
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,400
Kamala Harris,NA,"When black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America, when the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death, when black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women, who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be, where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?",Candidate,female,5,1,401
Kamala Harris,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,402
Kamala Harris,NA,"And I'm running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks. And we've got to re-create the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, that's people of color, that's our LGBTQ community, that's working people, that's our labor unions. But that is how we are going to win this election, and I intend to win.",Candidate,female,5,1,403
Kristen Welker,NA,"Senator Harris, thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,404
Kristen Welker,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, your response to that.",Moderator,female,5,1,405
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"My response is, I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me.",Candidate,male,5,1,406
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And before I share what's in my plans, let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.",Candidate,male,5,1,407
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society.",Candidate,male,5,1,408
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.",Candidate,male,5,1,409
Kristen Welker,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you very much.",Moderator,female,5,1,410
Kristen Welker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,5,1,411
Kristen Welker,NA,"Senator Harris, quick response?",Moderator,female,5,1,412
Kamala Harris,NA,"Look, there's a lot at stake in this election, and I've said it many times, I think justice is on the ballot in 2020. And it's about economic justice. It's about justice for children. It's about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list.",Candidate,female,5,1,413
Kamala Harris,NA,"And so the issue really is not what is the fight. The issue has to be, how are we going to win? And to win, we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that's the last time we won.",Candidate,female,5,1,414
Kamala Harris,NA,"And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities, and has the ability to bring people together. And everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and, therefore, ability to bring folks together around our commonalities, of which I believe there are many.",Candidate,female,5,1,415
Kristen Welker,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,5,1,416
Kristen Welker,NA,"Senator Warren, quickly?",Moderator,female,5,1,417
Elizabeth Warren,NA,So I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we're willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice.,Candidate,female,5,1,418
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now in America, African-Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they're in college, and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out, 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94 percent of them have paid off their student loan debt, 5 percent of African-Americans have paid it off.",Candidate,female,5,1,419
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I believe that means everyone on this stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let's do something tangible and real to make change in this country.,Candidate,female,5,1,420
Kristen Welker,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you. Ashley?",Moderator,female,5,1,421
Ashley Parker,NA,"Senator Warren, back to you. You've said that the border wall that President Trump has proposed is, quote, ""a monument to hate and division."" Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation's southern border?",Moderator,female,5,1,422
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border.",Candidate,female,5,1,423
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Trump is the one who has created this crisis, and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid. That means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity.",Candidate,female,5,1,424
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, when I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border. I went down there immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There's like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys.",Candidate,female,5,1,425
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers, and she told me she'd given a drink to a police officer and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border.",Candidate,female,5,1,426
Elizabeth Warren,NA,We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day.,Candidate,female,5,1,427
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,428
Ashley Parker,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,5,1,429
Ashley Parker,NA,"Senator Booker, a quick response.",Moderator,female,5,1,430
Cory Booker,NA,"Look, I want to be quick on this because I'd like to get back to something I wasn't included in, is...",Candidate,male,5,1,431
Elizabeth Warren,NA,So would we all.,Candidate,female,5,1,432
Cory Booker,NA,"Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it, it's just wrong. We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong.",Candidate,male,5,1,433
Cory Booker,NA,I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters; I've been one since I was 18.,Candidate,male,5,1,434
Cory Booker,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,435
Cory Booker,NA,"Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they're worried. They're pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote. And they're worried because the Democratic Party, we don't want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that doesn't -- isn't trusted, doesn't have authentic connection.",Candidate,male,5,1,436
Cory Booker,NA,"And so that's what's on the ballot. And issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week, I hear him literally say that I don't think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it.",Candidate,male,5,1,437
Cory Booker,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,438
Cory Booker,NA,"And let me tell you, because -- because marijuana -- marijuana -- marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it's -- the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.",Candidate,male,5,1,439
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,440
Cory Booker,NA,"And so let me just -- let me just say this. With more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children, because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people -- our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes.",Candidate,male,5,1,441
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,442
Cory Booker,NA,And so these are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community. And if we don't have somebody authentically -- we lost the last election. Let me just give you this data example.,Candidate,male,5,1,443
Ashley Parker,NA,"Quickly. Quickly, please.",Moderator,female,5,1,444
Cory Booker,NA,"We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive diminution -- a lot of reasons, but there was a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers.",Candidate,male,5,1,445
Ashley Parker,NA,"Thank you, Senator Booker. Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.",Moderator,female,5,1,446
Joe Biden,NA,"I'll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think everyone -- anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged, be completely zeroed out.",Candidate,male,5,1,447
Joe Biden,NA,"But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That's all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.",Candidate,male,5,1,448
Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, I'm -- you know, I'm part of that Obama coalition. I come out of a black community, in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people...",Candidate,male,5,1,449
Kamala Harris,NA,"No, that's not true.",Candidate,female,5,1,450
Cory Booker,NA,That's not true.,Candidate,male,5,1,451
Kamala Harris,NA,The other one is here.,Candidate,female,5,1,452
Kamala Harris,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,453
Joe Biden,NA,"No, I said the first. I said the first African-American woman. The first African-American woman.",Candidate,male,5,1,454
Joe Biden,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,455
Joe Biden,NA,"So my point is -- my point is that one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship, longstanding relationship with the black community. I was part of that coalition.",Candidate,male,5,1,456
Ashley Parker,NA,Thank you. Kristen?,Moderator,female,5,1,457
Kristen Welker,NA,"And we do have to take another quick break, but we are going to hear much more from the candidates when we come right back here in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.",Moderator,female,5,1,458
Kristen Welker,(COMMERCIAL BREAK),NA,Moderator,female,5,1,459
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Welcome back to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion. Right now, Roe v. Wade protects a woman's right to abortion nationwide. But if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back?",Moderator,female,5,1,460
Rachel Maddow,NA,Senator Klobuchar?,Moderator,female,5,1,461
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, of course. We should codify Roe v. Wade into law. That is what we should do.",Candidate,female,5,1,462
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,463
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And this president indicated early on what he was going to do, and he's done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail. Then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail. So no surprise that we're seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, in Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills.",Candidate,female,5,1,464
Amy Klobuchar,NA,And what we have to remember is that the people are with us. And I predict this will be a big election -- issue in the general election. And I just can't wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him. You know what? The people are with us. Over 70 percent of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90 percent of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the health care they need.,Candidate,female,5,1,465
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,466
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America, and this is how we're going to win this election.",Candidate,female,5,1,467
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Just this weekend, Louisiana re-elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. He has signed one of the country's toughest laws restricting abortion. Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him, someone who can win in a deep red state but who does not support abortion rights?",Moderator,female,5,1,468
Rachel Maddow,NA,Senator Warren?,Moderator,female,5,1,469
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party.",Candidate,female,5,1,470
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Understand this. When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It's just going to fall hard on poor women. It's going to fall hard on girls, women who don't even know that they're pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance.",Candidate,female,5,1,471
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And I know it can be a hard decision for people. But here's the thing. When it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother, she should be able to call on her partner, she should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi. But the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.",Candidate,female,5,1,472
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,473
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Warren, I'm going to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question. Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana. Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with those politics?",Moderator,female,5,1,474
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for. I'm not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I'm not here to try to build fences. But I am here to say, this is what I will fight for as president of the United States. The women of America can count on that.",Candidate,female,5,1,475
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you. Senator Sanders, I'll give you 30 seconds.",Moderator,female,5,1,476
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let me just -- Amy mentioned that women feel strongly on it. Well, let me just tell you that if there's ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment.",Candidate,male,5,1,477
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,478
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say get the government off our backs, we want small government. Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.",Candidate,male,5,1,479
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Sanders, thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,480
Cory Booker,NA,This is a voting issue.,Candidate,male,5,1,481
Rachel Maddow,NA,Senator Booker?,Moderator,female,5,1,482
Cory Booker,NA,"This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African-American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams right now.",Candidate,male,5,1,483
Cory Booker,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,484
Cory Booker,NA,"And that is, when you have undemocratic means, when you suppress people's votes to get elected, those are the very people you're going to come after when you're in office. And this bill, opposed by over 70 percent -- the heartbeat bill here -- opposed by over 70 percent of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day, that whoever is the nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low-income and minority voters, and particularly in the black community, like we saw here in Georgia.",Candidate,male,5,1,485
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Booker, thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,486
Rachel Maddow,NA,"And to that point, individual states, as you all know, set their own rules for voting and for elections. Depending on where you live, you may be required to show ID or not. You might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none. You might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town.",Moderator,female,5,1,487
Rachel Maddow,NA,"With that in mind, our next question comes from Jenna in Maryland, who asks, what will you do at the executive level to ensure that every American has equal access to the ballot box?",Moderator,female,5,1,488
Rachel Maddow,NA,Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,female,5,1,489
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century, because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro-democracy, anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell's hands in the United States Senate.",Candidate,male,5,1,490
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, Election Day a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and, in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of elections before the voting even begins.",Candidate,male,5,1,491
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Right now, we have politicians picking out their voters, rather than the other way around. That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.",Candidate,male,5,1,492
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I just -- I want to add this...,Candidate,female,5,1,493
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And while these process issues are not always fashionable, we must act to reform our democracy itself, including when it comes to choosing our presidency...",Candidate,male,5,1,494
Pete Buttigieg,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,495
Rachel Maddow,NA,Senator Klobuchar...,Moderator,female,5,1,496
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"... like we do in every other election, giving it to the person who got the most votes.",Candidate,male,5,1,497
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I want to point out...,Candidate,female,5,1,498
Amy Klobuchar,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,female,5,1,499
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and of leading 11 of the bills that are in that House-passed bill you just referred to.",Candidate,female,5,1,500
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I've got to the Senate. And I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task, a bipartisan bill to say, yeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they're paid for, and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don't have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill. And I am so close to getting it done. And the way I get it done is if I'm president.",Candidate,female,5,1,501
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But just like I have won statewide and mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.",Candidate,female,5,1,502
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, I'll let you respond to that.",Moderator,female,5,1,503
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So, first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?",Candidate,male,5,1,504
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces, and our marriages. And I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late.",Candidate,male,5,1,505
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Mr. Mayor, thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard, on the original question of voting rights, please.",Moderator,female,5,1,506
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Thank you. I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I've introduced legislation called the Securing Americas Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter's voice is heard.",Candidate,female,5,1,507
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"But I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comments about experience. Pete, you'll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander-in-chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.",Candidate,female,5,1,508
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"As commander-in-chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience, serving for seven years in Congress, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands...",Candidate,female,5,1,509
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Congresswoman, thank you.",Moderator,female,5,1,510
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"... dealing with high-level national security briefings, understanding what's necessary, the preparation that I've gotten to walk in on day one to serve as commander-in-chief.",Candidate,female,5,1,511
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Congresswoman, thank you. Mr. Mayor, I'll allow you to respond.",Moderator,female,5,1,512
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So I've got to respond to that. I know that it's par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today's politics.",Candidate,male,5,1,513
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,Are you saying that you didn't say that?,Candidate,female,5,1,514
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We've been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?",Candidate,male,5,1,515
Pete Buttigieg,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,516
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,That's not what I said. That's not what I said.,Candidate,female,5,1,517
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I'm talking about building up -- I'm talking about building up alliances. And if your question is about experience, let's also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not since it wasn't accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.",Candidate,male,5,1,518
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,519
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Congresswoman Gabbard, let me allow you to respond.",Moderator,female,5,1,520
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes. The fact-checkers can check this out.,Candidate,female,5,1,521
Pete Buttigieg,NA,No.,Candidate,male,5,1,522
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"But your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment. And what you've just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.",Candidate,female,5,1,523
Pete Buttigieg,NA,Like Donald Trump who met with Kim.,Candidate,male,5,1,524
Tulsi Gabbard,NA,"Like Reagan, who met -- like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm's way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. I'll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.",Candidate,female,5,1,525

Rachel Maddow,NA,"Senator Sanders, I'm going to have you respond.",Moderator,female,5,1,530
Bernie Sanders,NA,"To your original point, the American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt. And it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United which allows billionaires to buy elections.",Candidate,male,5,1,531
Bernie Sanders,NA,"So what we need to do, simple and straightforward, in every state in this country through the federal government, if you are 18, you have a right to vote, end of discussion.",Candidate,male,5,1,532
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,5,1,533

Rachel Maddow,NA,"On this last point, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,5,1,535
Tom Steyer,NA,"I agree exactly with what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we're going to win in 2020. I don't mean to change the subject, but I think it's sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020 but have a sweeping victory across the country. And what that's going to mean is turnout.",Candidate,male,5,1,536
Tom Steyer,NA,"In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don't vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote?",Candidate,male,5,1,537
Tom Steyer,NA,"But what we've found at NextGen America is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. And if you look at 2018 and flipping the House, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three-quarters. In the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people, the turnout went up by more than 100 percent, more than double.",Candidate,male,5,1,538
Rachel Maddow,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,5,1,539

We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it, and the majority of Americans are with us on it, and yet we don't make change. Why not?",Candidate,female,5,1,620
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Because of corruption. Because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms instead of into our public schools. We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else.,Candidate,female,5,1,621

Judy Woodruff,NA,And let's begin.,Moderator,female,6,1,7
Judy Woodruff,NA,"To the candidates -- last night, at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike 1974 and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have, so far, not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump.",Moderator,female,6,1,8
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Why do you think that is, and what can you say or do differently in the coming weeks to persuade more Americans that this is the right thing to do?",Moderator,female,6,1,9
Judy Woodruff,NA,"I want to ask all of you to respond, but to begin with Vice President Biden.",Moderator,female,6,1,10
Joe Biden,NA,"You know, Judy, it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did. And, you know, Trump's response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now, I find, is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do. You know, is it any wonder that if you look at the international polling that's been done, that the Chinese leader is rated above American -- the American president or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, stand fast and, in fact, it was a mistake to impeach him.",Candidate,male,6,1,11
Joe Biden,NA,"You know, we need to restore the integrity of the presidency, the office of the presidency, and it's about time we get that underway. My job and I think the job of all of us up here is to, in fact -- well, that's not true, some are going to actually be voting in the Senate -- but my job is just to go out and make the case why he doesn't deserve to be president of the United States for another four years.",Candidate,male,6,1,12
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator Sanders, why do you think more people are not in support of impeachment and what else can you do?",Moderator,female,6,1,13
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country, and we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign, he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else.",Candidate,male,6,1,14
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president ho has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president.",Candidate,male,6,1,15
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And the case is to be made is -- yes, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand is that we cannot have a president with that temperament who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.",Candidate,male,6,1,16
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator Warren, why do you think --",Moderator,female,6,1,17
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,18
Judy Woodruff,NA,-- why do you think more Americans don't agree that this is the right thing to do? And what more can you say?,Moderator,female,6,1,19
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate who has taken a constitutional oath to uphold our Constitution -- and that doesn't mean loyalty to an individual, it doesn't mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country -- and that vote will play out over the next several weeks.",Candidate,female,6,1,20
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But the way I see this is we've now seen the impact of corruption, and that's what's clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history.",Candidate,female,6,1,21
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, this president has made corruption originally his argument that he would drain the swamp, and, yet, he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships.",Candidate,female,6,1,22
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight not for the wealthy and well-connected but to fight for everyone else. That's why I'm in this race.",Candidate,female,6,1,23

Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, what argument can you make to persuade more Americans this is the right thing?",Moderator,female,6,1,25
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, the president is not king in America, the law is king. And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the Constitutional Convention -- and, by the way, I think he's a pretty good size for a president, he was five-foot-four.",Candidate,female,6,1,26
Amy Klobuchar,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,27
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the Constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here.",Candidate,female,6,1,28
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Watergate -- this is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent.",Candidate,female,6,1,29
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I would make this case: as we face this trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesn't he have all the presidents men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify.",Candidate,female,6,1,30
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,31

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The president left the House with no choice, and I think a lot of us are watching this process, watching Washington go through the motions, and not expecting much but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate.",Candidate,male,6,1,39
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We cannot give in to that sense of helplessness, because that's what they want. They want us to be taken in by that cynicism to where we give up on the process altogether. Meanwhile, their allies are laughing all the way to the bank, as we see policies that let giant corporations -- some of which made billions in profits, pay not just zero, but as we've recently learned negative taxes -- all the while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working Americans.",Candidate,male,6,1,40
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Here's the good news: it's up to us. No matter what happens in the Senate, it is up to us in 2020. This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness, to refuse and reject the cynicism.",Candidate,male,6,1,41
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"That is what this presidential election is about. It is what my campaign is about: our opportunity in 2020, no matter what happens in Washington, as a country, to change the course of this nation for the better.",Candidate,male,6,1,42

Tom Steyer,NA,"Well, let me remind everyone that I'm the person who started the Need to Impeach Movement over two years ago because I --",Candidate,male,6,1,51
Tom Steyer,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,52
Tom Steyer,NA,"-- because I believe what counts here is actually the American people's opinion. Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that, actually, the most corrupt president in American history -- it's not a question of political expediency, it's not a question of political tactics, it's a question of right and wrong.",Candidate,male,6,1,53
Tom Steyer,NA,"So, now, when we look at what's going on, I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar. The question here is, if we want the American people to understand what's going on, we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge.",Candidate,male,6,1,54
Tom Steyer,NA,"The court that counts here is the court of public opinion. The American people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath so we can make up our mind. If we want Republican senators to do the right thing, we need their constituents to see the truth on TV and tell them, get rid of this guy or we'll get rid of you.",Candidate,male,6,1,55
Tom Steyer,NA,"That's what I believe in. I'm a believer in the grassroots as an outsider, getting the American people's voice to count. That's who I trust and that's who I trust now.",Candidate,male,6,1,56

Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,58
Andrew Yang,NA,"It's clear why Americans can't agree on impeachment, we're getting news from different sources, and it's making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating, last I checked, was something like 17 percent, and Americans don't trust the media networks to tell them the truth.",Candidate,male,6,1,59
Andrew Yang,NA,"The media networks didn't do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place. If your turn on cable network news today, you would think he's our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and emails all mixed together.",Candidate,male,6,1,60
Andrew Yang,NA,"But Americans around the country know different. We blasted away 4 million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri. I just left Iowa -- we blasted 40,000 manufacturing jobs there.",Candidate,male,6,1,61
Andrew Yang,NA,"The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what's going on in our communities and solve those problems.",Candidate,male,6,1,62
Andrew Yang,NA,"What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which, unfortunately, strikes many Americans like a ball game where you know what the score is going to be, and actually start digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country, a new way forward to help beat him in 2020 because, make no mistake, he'll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat.",Candidate,male,6,1,63
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang.",Moderator,female,6,1,64
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,65
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Let's turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all Americans, and that is the economy.",Moderator,female,6,1,66
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. It was supported by union-friendly leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and big labor groups like the AFL-CIO. They say it is going to be a big job creator.",Moderator,female,6,1,67
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator, my question is, will you support this deal? And, if not, why not?",Moderator,female,6,1,68
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Judy, you're talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNTR with China -- two agreements that cost us over 4 million decent-paying jobs.",Candidate,male,6,1,69
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, I don't agree with the -- your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions, independent unions and be able to negotiate decent contracts.",Candidate,male,6,1,70
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than $2 an hour.",Candidate,male,6,1,71
Bernie Sanders,NA,"What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers. And, by the way, the word ""climate change,"" to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So, no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements.",Candidate,male,6,1,72
Judy Woodruff,NA,Senator Klobuchar?,Moderator,female,6,1,73
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I have a different view. I'll go with my friend, Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that's come in front of him, and he's voting for this, and I am, too.",Candidate,female,6,1,74
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we've got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also opposed.",Candidate,female,6,1,75
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Ninety-five percent of our customers are outside of our borders. And we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says ""Made in America,"" it is the ingenuity of our workers, it is the quality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people.",Candidate,female,6,1,76
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think this agreement -- while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it -- is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal.",Candidate,female,6,1,77
Judy Woodruff,NA,"All right, we can pull some of your -- I see some other hands up. I want to move to the next question, and you can bring in, I think, your points with this.",Moderator,female,6,1,78
Judy Woodruff,NA,"This one I'm going to initially address to Vice President Biden, and that is the overall U.S. economy right now looks strong. The unemployment rate is at historic lows. Unemployment among African-Americans is down. The markets are booming. Wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they're still doing about as well as they were in the Obama-Biden era.",Moderator,female,6,1,79
Judy Woodruff,NA,"My question to you, Mr. Vice President, is what is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight who may not like everything President Trump does but they really like this economy and they don't know why they should make a change.",Moderator,female,6,1,80
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, I don't think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighborhoods and middle-class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed. And the working class has no way up as a consequence of that.",Candidate,male,6,1,81
Joe Biden,NA,"You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest, 40 percent of them couldn't pay their bills last year. You have most Americans, if they received a bill for $400 or more, they'd have to sell something or borrow the money.",Candidate,male,6,1,82
Joe Biden,NA,The middle class is not as behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate a significant number of these god-awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in health care. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle-class people so they can maintain their standard of living.,Candidate,male,6,1,83
Joe Biden,NA,"That's not being done. And the idea that we're growing -- we're not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are. And that's why we must change this presidency now.",Candidate,male,6,1,84
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,85
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, is that your -- is that your assessment?",Moderator,female,6,1,86
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Yes. Where I live, folks aren't measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking. They're measuring the economy by how they're doing. When you're doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table, and you find that even if your wages have gone up, it's not nearly going as fast as the cost of health and housing.",Candidate,male,6,1,87
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"This economy is not working for most of us, for the middle class, and -- I know you're only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we've got to talk about poverty in this country. There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full-time at the minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment. In most places, not even a one-bedroom apartment.",Candidate,male,6,1,88
Pete Buttigieg,NA,The biggest problem in our economy is simple: People are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. It's the result of bad policy. And we've got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers.,Candidate,male,6,1,89
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,90
Judy Woodruff,NA,Mr. Yang? Mr. Yang?,Moderator,female,6,1,91
Andrew Yang,NA,"GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today. Also at record highs? Depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt.",Candidate,male,6,1,92
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,93
Andrew Yang,NA,Even suicides and drug overdoses. It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history.,Candidate,male,6,1,94
Andrew Yang,NA,"The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people's lived experience on the ground. If you're a recent college graduate, you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesn't require a college degree. That doesn't show up in the headline unemployment rate, nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by.",Candidate,male,6,1,95

Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator Warren, you have your hand up.",Moderator,female,6,1,97
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I do.,Candidate,female,6,1,98
Judy Woodruff,NA,And I have a question for you.,Moderator,female,6,1,99
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Well, I want to answer this question.",Candidate,female,6,1,100
Judy Woodruff,NA,Go ahead. Go ahead.,Moderator,female,6,1,101
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Because here's the problem. I'm proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rise in GDP, rise in corporate profits is not being felt by millions of families across this country. I'm proud to stand on a stage with people who see that America's middle class is being hollowed out and that working families and poor people are being left behind.",Candidate,female,6,1,102
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What we need to talk about, though, is why that has happened. And the answer is we've got a government that works great for those with money and doesn't work for much of anyone else. We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money on private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart.",Candidate,female,6,1,103
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us.",Candidate,female,6,1,104
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,105
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected and for no one else, that is corruption, pure and simple. And we need to call it out for what it is.",Candidate,female,6,1,106
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,107
Judy Woodruff,NA,"I want -- I want, Senator Sanders, if you would, a brief response, and then I have another question.",Moderator,female,6,1,108
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Look, here's the response. Trump goes around saying the economy is doing great. Do you know what real inflation accounted for wages went up last year? 1.1 percent. That ain't great.",Candidate,male,6,1,109
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 500,000 Americans, including 30,000 veterans, are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality than since the 1920s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent. That is what our campaign is about.",Candidate,male,6,1,110
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,111
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Senator Warren, I have a question for you. Every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy. But you have especially ambitious plans that, apart from health care, would hike taxes an additional $8 trillion over the decade, the biggest tax increase since World War II. How do you answer top economists who say taxes of this magnitude would stifle growth and investment?",Moderator,female,6,1,112
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Oh, they're just wrong.",Candidate,female,6,1,113
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,114
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Let's start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two-cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, $50 million and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age 0 to 5, universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old, and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher.",Candidate,female,6,1,115
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates. We can cancel student loan debt. But think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires, they're not eating more pizzas, they're not buying more cars. We invest that 2 percent in early childhood education and childcare, that means those babies get top-notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas and their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours.",Candidate,female,6,1,116
Judy Woodruff,NA,And...,Moderator,female,6,1,117
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can increase productivity in this country. And we can start building this economy from the ground up. That's how we build it in small towns. That's how we build it in rural America. And that's how we built it in urban America. An economy that works, not for Wall Street, but that works for Main Street.",Candidate,female,6,1,118
Judy Woodruff,NA,Brief answers -- brief responses from Mr. Steyer and Mr. Buttigieg.,Moderator,female,6,1,119
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,120
Tom Steyer,NA,So let me say that I agree with Senator Warren in much of what she says. I've been for a wealth tax for over a year. I'm in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations that this administration has put through.,Candidate,male,6,1,121
Tom Steyer,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,122
Tom Steyer,NA,"And in addition, I've talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans by 10 percent.",Candidate,male,6,1,123
Tom Steyer,NA,"But there's something else going on here that I think is really important, and that's this. We know Mr. Trump is going to run on the economy. I built a business over 30 years from scratch. We're going to have to take him on, on the economy in terms of growth, as well as economic justice. We're going to have to be able to talk about growth, prosperity across the board for everyone in America.",Candidate,male,6,1,124
Tom Steyer,NA,"My experience building a business, understanding how to make that happen, means I can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure. And I think that's different from the other people on this stage. I think we need a different, unconventional way of attacking a different, unconventional president who actually went after the best-prepared candidate in American history and beat her.",Candidate,male,6,1,125
Judy Woodruff,NA,Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,female,6,1,126
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We're also being -- right now, I think we're being offered a false choice that you either have to go all the way to the extreme or it's business as usual. Yes, we must deliver big ideas and, yes, taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up.",Candidate,male,6,1,127
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We can also be smart about the promises we're making, make sure they're promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy.",Candidate,male,6,1,128
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It's why, for example, I've proposed that we make college free for 80 percent of Americans. But it doesn't have to be free for the top. If you're in that top 10 percent, how about you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on that would make a big difference, whether it's infrastructure, childcare, housing, health?",Candidate,male,6,1,129
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"On issue after issue, we've got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize.",Candidate,male,6,1,130

Announcer,NA,"Live from Los Angeles, the PBS NewsHour/Politico Democratic debate continues. Once again, Judy Woodruff.",Moderator,unknown,6,1,135
Judy Woodruff,NA,Welcome back to the PBS NewsHour/Politico Democratic presidential debate. The next question is from Tim Alberta of Politico.,Moderator,female,6,1,136
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thanks, Judy. Candidates, good evening. We're going to talk about climate now. Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the U.S. reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050, the damage will have been done, that climate change will have made certain places in the U.S. unlivable.",Moderator,male,6,1,137
Tim Alberta,NA,"So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps, Davenport, Iowa, because we know these places are going to be hit time and time again?",Moderator,male,6,1,138
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, I don't -- I very much hope we're not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents.",Candidate,female,6,1,139
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And the problem right now is that this climate change is an existential crisis. And you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California, as was mentioned with Paradise. And the most moving video from that to me was the 30-second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down.",Candidate,female,6,1,140
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We cannot wait to act. There is an Ojibway saying that great leaders make decisions not for this generation, but seven generations from now. This president doesn't keep his decisions for seven minutes.",Candidate,female,6,1,141
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,142
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So what I think we need to do, get back into the international climate change agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules. On day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California, who's been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduce sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards.",Candidate,female,6,1,143
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Moderator,male,6,1,144
Tim Alberta,NA,"Mr. Steyer, would you support such a new federal program, again, to help subsidize the relocation of these families?",Moderator,male,6,1,145
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, I am hoping that we, in fact, will do what I'm suggesting, which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency. I have made this -- I believe I'm the only person here who will say unequivocally this is my number-one priority.",Candidate,male,6,1,146
Tom Steyer,NA,I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. I've been working on this for more than a decade. I've taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws. I've pushed clean energy across this country. I've prevented pipelines and I've prevented fossil fuel plants.,Candidate,male,6,1,147
Tom Steyer,NA,"But what I know is this: Not only can we clear up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated, this is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle-class union jobs, well-paid, across the United States of America.",Candidate,male,6,1,148
Tom Steyer,NA,"Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity. And if we don't declare a state of emergency on day one, I don't understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead.",Candidate,male,6,1,149
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage. I know everybody is worried about this. But, for instance, I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now, but it's also...",Candidate,male,6,1,150
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,male,6,1,151
Tom Steyer,NA,... the greatest opportunity to rebuild and reinvent America.,Candidate,male,6,1,152
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond.",Moderator,male,6,1,153
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,154
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, I've made clear that this will be a topic of day one action. And this is not theoretical for me. I live in one of those river cities that you're talking about. Not only that, I live right by the river. My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years. Do the math on that. So I know what's at stake.",Candidate,male,6,1,155
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And it's why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research, on renewable energy, energy storage, and carbon storage. But bigger than that, we have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this.",Candidate,male,6,1,156
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I've seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change as long as I've been alive, all these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050. And I think most or all of us have one. Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done.",Candidate,male,6,1,157
Tim Alberta,NA,We'd like to switch...,Moderator,male,6,1,158
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the autoworker down the block from me in South Bend to a farmer a few minutes away so that they understand that we are asking, recruiting them to be part of the solution, not beating them over the head and telling them they're part of the problem.",Candidate,male,6,1,159
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We'd like to switch gears slightly.",Moderator,male,6,1,160
Tim Alberta,NA,"Vice President Biden, I'd like to ask you. Three consecutive American presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production. As president, would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth, even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy?",Moderator,male,6,1,161
Joe Biden,NA,"The answer is yes. The answer is yes, because the opportunity -- the opportunity for those workers to transition to high-paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. We're the only country in the world that's ever taken great, great crises and turned them into enormous opportunities.",Candidate,male,6,1,162
Joe Biden,NA,"I've met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, be making that -- making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn't leak energy, that, in fact -- we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make their homes turn to solar power, where -- there's all kinds of folks out here, right here in California, who are now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when, in fact, the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining.",Candidate,male,6,1,163
Joe Biden,NA,"We have enormous opportunities. For example, you talk about, would we relocate people who, in fact, were in a position where they lost their home? We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people. We have to rebuild with the standard that exists today.",Candidate,male,6,1,164
Joe Biden,NA,"For example, we shouldn't build another new highway in America that doesn't have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electrical vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people installing them, as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. There are so many things we can do, and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced, that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities.",Candidate,male,6,1,165
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Vice President Biden.",Moderator,male,6,1,166
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,167
Tim Alberta,NA,Senator Sanders?,Moderator,male,6,1,168
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren.",Candidate,male,6,1,169
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,170
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You're talking about the Paris agreement, that's fine. Ain't enough. We have got to -- and I've introduced legislation to do this -- declare a national emergency.",Candidate,male,6,1,171
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The United States has got to lead the world. And maybe, just maybe, instead of spending $1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders, can lead the world, instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.",Candidate,male,6,1,172
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Thank you, Senator Sanders.",Moderator,male,6,1,173
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,174
Tim Alberta,NA,"Senator Warren, a new question to you, Senator Warren. Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because it's efficient, affordable, and virtually carbon-free. And many climate experts believe that it's impossible to realize your goal of net zero emissions by the year 2050 without utilizing nuclear energy. So can you have it both ways on this issue?",Moderator,male,6,1,175
Elizabeth Warren,NA,So I see right now is we've got to get the carbon -- we've got to stop putting more carbon into the air. We've got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water. And that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place.,Candidate,female,6,1,176
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy, literally, and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by tenfold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best, and that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader.",Candidate,female,6,1,177
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But understand, the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keep saying the right thing but continue to take money from the oil industry, continue to bow down to the lobbyists, to the lawyers, to the think-tanks, to the bought-and-paid-for experts.",Candidate,female,6,1,178
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"America understands that we've got to make change and we're running out of time, that climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. But getting Congress to act, you know, they just don't want to hear it. And if we don't attack the corruption first, if we don't attack the corruption head-on, then we're not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate, on gun safety, on drug pricing, on all of the big problems that face us.",Candidate,female,6,1,179

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Yeah, I want to add to what Elizabeth said. So the way we tackle corruption is by winning big in this election. And the way we take on climate change in a big way is by, yes, talking about what's happening on the coasts, as I just did, but also talking about what's happening in the Midwest, where I'm from. It's not flyover country to me. I live there.",Candidate,female,6,1,185
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We're seeing an increase, 50 percent increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years. And when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon, that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change, and to make them whole with their energy bills.",Candidate,female,6,1,186
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes. You win big. And I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who is from the Midwest.",Candidate,female,6,1,187

Andrew Yang,NA,"Well, first, we should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change. We're already doing it. We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose. And we know that town is not alone. That's playing out in coastal areas around the country.",Candidate,male,6,1,190

Tom Steyer,NA,"We actually have the technology that we need. It's called wind and solar and batteries. So, in fact, what we need to do, we can do.

Joe Biden,NA,"Look, I didn't say return to normal. Normal's not enough. Normal -- in fact, we have to move beyond normal, whether it's health care, the environment, whatever it is.

They have numbers. The average net worth of a black household is only 10 percent that of a white household. For Latinos, it's 12 percent. If you're a black woman, you're 320 percent more likely to die from complications in childbirth.",Candidate,male,6,1,214

Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that you think China presents more of a challenge than do your fellow candidates believe. The U.S. clearly wants China's cooperation on human rights, on climate change, on North Korea, on terrorism. And yet Americans are appalled by China's record on human rights, including the detention of over a million Muslim Uighurs. Should the U.S., is my question, do more than protest and issue sanctions?

Judy Woodruff,NA,Now let's turn to the next question from Tim.,Moderator,female,6,1,319
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Judy. Candidates, let's make things interesting. Former President Obama said this week when asked who should be running countries that if women were in charge, you'd see a significant improvement on just about everything.",Moderator,male,6,1,320
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,321
Tim Alberta,NA,"He also said, quote, ""If you look at the world and look at the problems, it's usually old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.""",Moderator,male,6,1,322
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,323
Tim Alberta,NA,"Senator Sanders, you are the oldest candidate on stage this evening.",Moderator,male,6,1,324
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And I'm white, as well. Yes.",Candidate,male,6,1,325
Tim Alberta,NA,How do you respond to what the former president had to say?,Moderator,male,6,1,326
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, I got a lot of respect for Barack Obama. I think I disagree with him on this one. Maybe a little self-serving, but I do disagree.",Candidate,male,6,1,327
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Here is the issue. The issue is where power resides in America, and it's not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians.",Candidate,male,6,1,328
Bernie Sanders,NA,"You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all.",Candidate,male,6,1,329
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and economy that works for all, not just the 1 percent.",Candidate,male,6,1,330
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Sanders.",Moderator,male,6,1,331
Tim Alberta,NA,"Vice President Biden, I'm going to guess that President Obama did not clear that remark through your campaign ahead of time.",Moderator,male,6,1,332
Joe Biden,NA,And I'm going to guess...,Candidate,male,6,1,333
Tim Alberta,NA,What do you say to it?,Moderator,male,6,1,334
Joe Biden,NA,"And I'm going to guess he wasn't talking about me, either.",Candidate,male,6,1,335
Joe Biden,NA,MORE,Candidate,male,6,1,336
Joe Biden,NA,"XXX about me, either.",Candidate,male,6,1,337
Tim Alberta,NA,OK.,Moderator,male,6,1,338
Joe Biden,NA,"Number one. Look, I'm running -- I'm running because I've been around, on my experience. With experience hopefully comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom. The fact is that we're in a position now, the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things, an economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be -- where we have to unite America. And a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able to on day one stand up, look out, the entire world know who that person is, know what they stand for, and know they know them.",Candidate,male,6,1,339
Joe Biden,NA,And that's what -- that's the reason I'm running. I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage.,Candidate,male,6,1,340
Tim Alberta,NA,"Just to follow up, Vice President Biden, if elected, if elected you would turn 82 at the end of your first term. You'd be the oldest president in American history.",Moderator,male,6,1,341
Joe Biden,NA,More like Winston Churchill.,Candidate,male,6,1,342
Tim Alberta,NA,Are you willing -- are you willing to commit -- American history.,Moderator,male,6,1,343
Joe Biden,NA,"Oh, American history.",Candidate,male,6,1,344
Tim Alberta,NA,Yes. Are you...,Moderator,male,6,1,345
Joe Biden,NA,I was joking. That was a joke.,Candidate,male,6,1,346
Tim Alberta,NA,OK.,Moderator,male,6,1,347
Tim Alberta,(LAUGHTER),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,348
Tim Alberta,NA,Appreciate it.,Moderator,male,6,1,349
Joe Biden,NA,Politico doesn't have much of a sense of humor.,Candidate,male,6,1,350
Tim Alberta,NA,"Oh, we've got a great sense of humor. They wouldn't have put me on stage otherwise. Are you willing to commit tonight to running for a second term if you're elected next November?",Moderator,male,6,1,351
Joe Biden,NA,"No, I'm not willing to commit one way or another. Here's the deal. I'm not even elected one term yet, and let's see where we are. Let's see what happens.",Candidate,male,6,1,352
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,353
Joe Biden,NA,But it's a nice thought.,Candidate,male,6,1,354
Tim Alberta,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you had your hand raised.",Moderator,male,6,1,355
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Thank you for asking a woman this question. I think...,Candidate,female,6,1,356
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,357
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"First of all, we have not had enough women in our government. When I was on Trevor Noah's show once, I explained how in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2,000 men and only 50 women in the whole history. And he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down.",Candidate,female,6,1,358
Amy Klobuchar,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,359
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"However, it is not just about numbers. It's about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll -- the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory, it showed that I'd beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage.",Candidate,female,6,1,360
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So I think what matters in this election is, can you bring in those rural and suburban areas, particularly in the Midwest? And number two, what will you do when you get there? And I am someone that has passed over 100 bills, with men and women, with Republicans and with Democrats, including changing the sexual harassment laws for the United States Congress, a bill I led so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people.",Candidate,female,6,1,361
Tim Alberta,NA,Senator Warren...,Moderator,male,6,1,362
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I have passed a law for drug shortages. I have done work in our rural areas. I think that's what most matters to people. I would be so proud to be the first woman president. But mostly I want to be a president that gets things done and improves people's lives.,Candidate,female,6,1,363
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Moderator,male,6,1,364
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,365
Tim Alberta,NA,"Senator Warren, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated. I'd like you to weigh in, as well.",Moderator,male,6,1,366
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I'd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated.,Candidate,female,6,1,367
Elizabeth Warren,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,368
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,369
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America, whose voices get heard. I believe he's talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out.",Candidate,female,6,1,370
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And for me, the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020. You know, I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual. And now I'm proud to have been in 100,000 selfies. That's 100,000 hugs and handshakes and stories, stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt, stories from people who can't pay their medical bills, stories from people who can't find childcare.",Candidate,female,6,1,371
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Now, most of the people on this stage run a traditional campaign. And that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up $5,000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken, in order to have a conversation, and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador.",Candidate,female,6,1,372
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,6,1,373
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Those selfies -- no, I want to finish this. Those selfies cost nobody anything. And I get it. In a democracy, we all have a lot of different points of view. And everybody gets one vote.",Candidate,female,6,1,374
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But here's the thing. People who can put down $5,000 to have a picture taken don't have the same priorities as people who are struggling with student loan debt or who are struggling to pay off medical debt.",Candidate,female,6,1,375
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I want -- I'm running a campaign where people whose voices get heard. We can't have...,Candidate,female,6,1,376
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren. We're...",Moderator,male,6,1,377
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can't have people who can put down $5,000 for a check drown out the voices of everyone else.",Candidate,female,6,1,378
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,6,1,379
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"They don't in my campaign, and they won't in my White House.",Candidate,female,6,1,380
Tim Alberta,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg -- Mayor Buttigieg, you had your hand raised.",Moderator,male,6,1,381
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,382
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, can't help but feel that might have been directed at me. And here is the thing. We're in the fight of our lives right now. Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing, not even foreign interference to hold onto power. They've already put together more than $300 million.",Candidate,male,6,1,383
Pete Buttigieg,NA,This is our chance. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. And we shouldn't try to do it with one hand tied behind our back.,Candidate,male,6,1,384
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The way we're going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight. If that means that you're a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica.com and chip in $10 bucks, that's great. And if you can drop $1,000 without blinking, that's great, too. We need everybody's help in this fight. I'm not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,6,1,385
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We need Democrats who've been with us all along, yes, but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country. If you're a Republican disgusted with what's going on in your own party, we're not going to agree on everything, but we need you in this fight, and I will welcome you to our side.",Candidate,male,6,1,386
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",Moderator,male,6,1,387
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,388
Tim Alberta,NA,"Senator Warren, 45 seconds to respond.",Moderator,male,6,1,389
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine. Think about who comes to that. He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door, but this one was closed door. We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States.",Candidate,female,6,1,390
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,391
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States.,Candidate,female,6,1,392
Tim Alberta,NA,"Mr. Mayor, your response?",Moderator,male,6,1,393
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"You know, according to Forbes magazine, I am literally the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire.",Candidate,male,6,1,394
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,395
Pete Buttigieg,NA,So if -- this is important. This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass.,Candidate,male,6,1,396
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,397
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"If I pledge -- if I pledge never to be in the company of a progressive Democratic donor, I couldn't be up here. Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Now, supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit -- I know this isn't likely, but stay with me -- and decided to go onto peteforamerica.com and gave the maximum allowable by law, $2,800, would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No, I would be glad to have that support. We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,6,1,398
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,399
Tim Alberta,NA,"We would like to bring everyone, but obviously, Senator Warren, would like to give you a chance to respond.",Moderator,male,6,1,400
Elizabeth Warren,NA,I do not sell access to my time. I don't do call time with millionaires and billionaires.,Candidate,female,6,1,401
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Hold on a second. Sorry, as of when, Senator?",Candidate,male,6,1,402
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I don't meet -- I don't meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors. And, look, I have taken one that ought to be an easy step for everyone here. I've said to anyone who wants to donate to me, if you want to donate to me, that's fine, but don't come around later expecting to be named ambassador, because that's what goes on in these high-dollar fundraisers.",Candidate,female,6,1,403
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I said no, and I asked everybody on this stage to join me. This ought to be an easy step. And here's the problem. If you can't stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy, can't stand up to the wealthy and well connected when it's relatively easy when you're a candidate, then how can the American people believe you're going to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when you're president and it's really hard?",Candidate,female,6,1,404
Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,405
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Judy -- Judy...,Candidate,female,6,1,406
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Senator, Senator, I've got to respond.",Candidate,male,6,1,407
Tim Alberta,NA,"Mr. Mayor, we're going to give you one more chance to respond.",Moderator,male,6,1,408
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"First of all, if you can't say no to a donor, then you have no business running for office in the first place. But also, Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big-ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not.",Candidate,male,6,1,409
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that President Obama went by, that Speaker Pelosi goes by, that you yourself went by until not long ago, in order to build the Democratic Party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives, these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election...",Candidate,male,6,1,410
Pete Buttigieg,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,411
Tim Alberta,NA,We'd like to bring everyone in. We'd like to bring everyone in.,Moderator,male,6,1,412
Tim Alberta,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,413
Tim Alberta,NA,"But, Senator Klobuchar, had your hand up first. We'd like to call on you.",Moderator,male,6,1,414
Tim Alberta,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,415
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I did not come here to listen to this argument. I came here to make a case for progress. And I have never even been to a wine cave. I've been to the wind cave in South Dakota, which I suggest you go to.",Candidate,female,6,1,416
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So what is making a case for progress about? That is what unites us up here instead of what divides us, which is campaign finance reform. That means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. It means making the first bill we pass when I am president will be H.R. 1, which is the ethics reform passed in the House, which is currently sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk, along with 400 bills. And if you don't think we can get this done, well, we can, but only if we win this election big.",Candidate,female,6,1,417
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,6,1,418
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Not by arguing with each other, but by finding what unites us and getting this done.",Candidate,female,6,1,419
Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,420
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I came to make a case for progress.,Candidate,female,6,1,421
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Sanders?",Moderator,male,6,1,422
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I am -- I am rather proud, maybe, I don't know, the only candidate up here that doesn't have any billionaire contributions. But you know what I do have? We have received more contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of the United States of America at this point in an election, averaging $18 a piece.",Candidate,male,6,1,423
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, there's a real competition going on up here. My good friend, Joe, and he is a good friend, he's received contributions from 44 billionaires. Pete, on the other hand, he's trailing, Pete. You only got 39 billionaires contributing. So, Pete, we look forward to you. I know you're an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you can take on Joe on that issue.",Candidate,male,6,1,424
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But what is not -- what is not a laughing matter, my friends, this is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half. This is why Amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes. We need to get money out of politics. We should run our campaigns on that basis.",Candidate,male,6,1,425
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,6,1,426
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,427
Tim Alberta,NA,"Vice President Biden, 45 seconds to respond.",Moderator,male,6,1,428
Joe Biden,NA,"My average contributions is $43, number one. That's number one.",Candidate,male,6,1,429
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, the idea that the senator suggested, that I am in the pocket of billionaires, when, in fact, they oppose everything that I have ever done and continue to do, I have made sure from the very beginning every one of my fundraisers is open to the press, every single solitary one. Not one single time, period.",Candidate,male,6,1,430
Joe Biden,NA,"And I have made sure that you know exactly where all the -- and the largest contribution I have accepted is $2,800, which is allowed under law. And I'm the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is no -- all public funding of elections. End all private funding.",Candidate,male,6,1,431
Joe Biden,NA,"And we all should take a commitment, make a commitment to that right now on this stage. In the meantime, you got to fund a campaign, and we, in fact, have funded a campaign, average contribution $43.",Candidate,male,6,1,432
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Vice President. Mr. Steyer, I would like to bring you in.",Moderator,male,6,1,433
Tom Steyer,NA,"Listen, I am running because this government is broken, because it's purchased by corporations. And I've spent 10 years fighting those corporations and beating them and building grassroots organizations to push power down to the people. That's what I've been doing for a decade.",Candidate,male,6,1,434
Tom Steyer,NA,"But let me say this. There's someone who is loving this conversation, and his name is Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,6,1,435
Joe Biden,NA,That's right.,Candidate,male,6,1,436
Tom Steyer,NA,"We know how he's going to run. He's told us last week he looked at a group of Americans and said, ""I don't like you. You don't like me. It doesn't matter. You're going to support me because the Democrats will destroy the economy in 15 minutes.""",Candidate,male,6,1,437
Tom Steyer,NA,"We need to go after this guy. He's a different breed of cat, and we need to beat him. And we need to talk about prosperity. And I spent 25 years building a business. We're going to have to take him on, on the economy, not have these kinds of conversations and tear each other down, but actually go after...",Candidate,male,6,1,438
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,male,6,1,439
Tom Steyer,NA,"... this corrupt president and beat him on the economy where he thinks he's king and where, in fact, he's a fraud and a failure.",Candidate,male,6,1,440
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. We're going to end it there.",Moderator,male,6,1,441
Tim Alberta,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,442
Tim Alberta,NA,Amna?,Moderator,male,6,1,443
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Thanks, Tim. I want to turn now to an issue that's been in the headlines quite a bit, and that is immigration. Mr. Yang, we have a question here from a professor right here at Loyola, Marymount. There are nearly 200,000 DACA recipients, so-called Dreamers, in the state of California, more than any other state, including several students right here at LMU. If you win and you reinstate DACA through executive action, another president could just overturn it again. So will you move on a permanent legislative fix for Dreamers in your first 100 days, if elected?",Moderator,female,6,1,444
Andrew Yang,NA,"Of course I would. I'm the son of immigrants myself, and I know that Dreamers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification.",Candidate,male,6,1,445
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,446
Andrew Yang,NA,"I just want to return to this conversation, because I think it's core. Our country is deeply misogynist, and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. That's where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation.",Candidate,male,6,1,447
Andrew Yang,NA,"The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons.",Candidate,male,6,1,448
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,449
Andrew Yang,NA,"I'm on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government, because the fact is, if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons.",Candidate,male,6,1,450
Andrew Yang,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,451
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,452
Andrew Yang,NA,"So it's related to our campaign finance rules, because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace. And that includes the marketplace for politicians. If we were to put 100 democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5 percent contributing, you'd see that rate skyrocket to 50 percent or 60 percent, and you'd have many, many more women who would run for office because they don't have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.",Candidate,male,6,1,453
Andrew Yang,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,454
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. I do...",Moderator,female,6,1,455
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Could I address...,Candidate,female,6,1,456
Amna Nawaz,NA,"I'd like to follow up. The question, again, Mr. Yang, was about Dreamers.",Moderator,female,6,1,457
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Could I address immigration reform?,Candidate,female,6,1,458
Amna Nawaz,NA,You pledged to move -- you pledged to move on a permanent legislative fix in your first 100 days. Dreamers say that they are frustrated by Democrats' failure to prioritize their status in deal after deal. So why should Dreamers trust Democrats now?,Moderator,female,6,1,459
Andrew Yang,NA,"I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by Dreamers in the first 100 days. I would make it a top priority. I'm the son of immigrants myself. The fact is, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants. Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic.",Candidate,male,6,1,460
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,461
Andrew Yang,NA,"And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, it's not wall-to-wall immigrants. It's wall-to-wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration.",Candidate,male,6,1,462
Andrew Yang,NA,"And as your president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if you are considering immigrating to this country and I am the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States. That's the opposite of the current administration, and that's the message I would love to send to the world.",Candidate,male,6,1,463
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Yang.",Moderator,female,6,1,464
Amna Nawaz,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,465
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Senator Sanders, a related question to you.",Moderator,female,6,1,466
Bernie Sanders,NA,Donald Trump...,Candidate,male,6,1,467
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Actually, Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, I have a new question for you. You can respond to Mr. Yang's comments, as well.",Moderator,female,6,1,468
Bernie Sanders,NA,I can't respond to the immigration question?,Candidate,male,6,1,469
Amna Nawaz,NA,"This is related, sir. But there are estimated to be as many as 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., more than 2 million right here in California. If you have a chance to forge a bipartisan immigration reform plan, would you insist on a path to citizenship for all 12 million or just a segment of that population?",Moderator,female,6,1,470
Bernie Sanders,NA,"This is what I would do. Day one, executive order, restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people in the DACA program.",Candidate,male,6,1,471
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,472
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Day one, we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers.",Candidate,male,6,1,473
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,474
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Day one, day one, we introduce bipartisan legislation, which will, in fact, be comprehensive, which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented. That is what the people of our country want.",Candidate,male,6,1,475
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,476
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win re-election by dividing us up. We are going to win this election by bringing our people together -- black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American. That's what this campaign is about. That's what America must be about.",Candidate,male,6,1,477
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,478
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, you had your hand up.",Moderator,female,6,1,479
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Thank you. I started my day-to-day with a group of immigrants who were there talking to me about housing. And I thought about this president and what he's done. He has used our immigrants as political pawns. Every single day, he tries to draw a wedge. I will be a different president.",Candidate,female,6,1,480
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"My view on this comes from experience. When I got to the Senate, Senator Kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package. We got so close to passing that. I voted for it. Not everyone did. But most of the Democrats did.",Candidate,female,6,1,481
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Then I was on the Judiciary Committee when President Obama was president. And we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes.,Candidate,female,6,1,482
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the Dreamers that would have solved that problem. We didn't get that done because this president gut-punched us.,Candidate,female,6,1,483
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,6,1,484

Elizabeth Warren,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,489
Tom Steyer,NA,"This is his attempt to divide us, as Senator Sanders said, on race. And that's what he's been doing since the very first day he started running for president. He's been vilifying non-white people. He's been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if, in fact, white people lose control of this country, that they're going to lose control of their lives.",Candidate,male,6,1,490
Tom Steyer,NA,"And as somebody who lives in a majority-minority state, which is California, what he's doing is so wrong on so many different levels.",Candidate,male,6,1,491
Tom Steyer,NA,I agree with Senator Sanders. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right. This is a racial argument by a racist president who's trying to divide us and who's vilifying people. It's absolutely wrong. And it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name.,Candidate,male,6,1,492

Amna Nawaz,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, a new question to you, Mr. Mayor. You said last month that the U.S. owes compensation to children separated from their families at the southern border. The consensus among child welfare experts is that those thousands of children will likely suffer lifelong trauma as a result of that separation. Are you committing as president to financial compensation for those thousands of children?",Moderator,female,6,1,495
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Yes, and they should have a fast track to citizenship, because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong. We have a moral obligation to make right what was broken.",Candidate,male,6,1,496
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isn't theoretical. It's not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family, came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. citizen.",Candidate,male,6,1,497
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It comes from the fact that I'm the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants. And I've seen those same neighborhoods shut down, families huddling in church, panicking just because of the rumor of an ICE raid. That did not make our country safer.",Candidate,male,6,1,498
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Could I respond?,Candidate,female,6,1,499
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I had to look into the eyes of an 8-year-old boy whose father was deported, even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name, and try to think of something to tell that boy because I couldn't tell him what he most wanted to hear, which is just that he was going to have his dad back. How could harming that young man possibly make America safer?",Candidate,male,6,1,500
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Mr. Mayor, just...",Moderator,female,6,1,501
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When I am president, based on those experiences, I will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values.

Amna Nawaz,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,506
Amna Nawaz,NA,"... since you do support compensation for those families, should the U.S. also compensate descendants of enslaved people? Do you support reparations for African-Americans?",Moderator,female,6,1,507
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I support H.R. 40, which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations. But we shouldn't wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative.",Candidate,male,6,1,508
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Remember, we're not talking about a gift to anybody. We're talking about mending what was broken. We're talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African-Americans. And just crossing out a racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver equality.",Candidate,male,6,1,509
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Harms compound, just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time. So does the value of a dollars stolen. And that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority-owned businesses, with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs, and on the longer term look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken.",Candidate,male,6,1,510

Joe Biden,NA,"The people who come here have determination, resilience. They are ready to stand up and work like the devil. We have 24 out of every 100 children in our schools today is Hispanic. The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral, but it's bad for America.",Candidate,male,6,1,514
Joe Biden,NA,"They are the future of America and we should invest in them. Everybody will benefit from it, every single American. And you should get used to it. This is a nation of immigrants.

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So I look at this a different way. When we were in the last debate, Mayor, you basically mocked the hundred years of experience on the stage. And what do I see on this stage?

Amy Klobuchar,NA,I have been -- I certainly respect your military experience. That's not what this is about. This is about choosing a president.,Candidate,female,6,1,534
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I know my view of this is I know you ran to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. That's not something that I wanted to do. I want to be president of the United States. And the point is, we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate Republicans and independents, as well as a fired-up Democratic base, and not just done it once, I have done it three times.",Candidate,female,6,1,535
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters. And I also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us, have a wider tent, have a bigger coalition, and, yes, longer coattails, that matters.",Candidate,female,6,1,536

Yamiche Alcindor,NA,"I'd like to turn to a new subject, and that is, of course, education. Senator Warren, you've proposed free public college tuition and student loan forgiveness for most families. Why should wealthy families be able to send their kids to public college for free? Why not concentrate that government help on those most in need?",Moderator,female,6,1,551
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, as I've talked about before, I have a two cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires, and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies, age 0 to 5, to put an historic $800 billion investment in public schools K through 12, and that will permit us to offer technical school, two-year college, four-year college for every single person who wants an education, cancel student loan debt for 50 -- put a $50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities, and cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans.",Candidate,female,6,1,552
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, this is about money, but this is also about values. We need to make an investment in our future, and the best way to do that is let's invest in the public education of our children. That starts when you're babies and it goes long after high school.",Candidate,female,6,1,553
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We want to have families. I meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt. That's why I have a proposal popular among Democrats, popular among Republicans, popular among independents, to ask those at the top to pay a little more so somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves, start a small business, buy a car, create a future for themselves and for this country.",Candidate,female,6,1,554
Yamiche Alcindor,NA,"Thank you, Senator. I see some hands, but I want to go to Mayor Buttigieg.",Moderator,female,6,1,555
Pete Buttigieg,NA,Can I respond?,Candidate,male,6,1,556
Yamiche Alcindor,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, your plan offers free or discounted public college only to families making up to $150,000 a year. Do you think Senator Warren's plan offers free college to too many families?",Moderator,female,6,1,557
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I do think that if you're in that lucky top 10 percent -- I still wish you well, don't get me wrong. I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition.",Candidate,male,6,1,558
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Now, we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that. But if you're in that top 10 percent, I think you're going to be for the most part OK.",Candidate,male,6,1,559
Pete Buttigieg,NA,And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes. So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires. I just don't agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition.,Candidate,male,6,1,560

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"The other part is we've got to deal with student loan debt. And right now, most of the people on this stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionally affects people of color. African-Americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school, more likely to borrow more money while they're in school, and have a harder time paying it off.",Candidate,female,6,1,567

Bernie Sanders,NA,"What we need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to end this dysfunctional childcare system and make sure that every working-class person in this country can find high-quality, affordable childcare.

So I'm wonderful, as president, are there specific steps that you would take to help people like Kyle become more integrated into the workforce and into their local communities?",Moderator,male,6,1,577
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, the United States has made a commitment to treat everybody equally. And that means supporting people with disabilities, both in terms of education and later when they're part of the workforce. That means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that we're treating them fairly, in school and after school, to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible.",Candidate,male,6,1,578
Tom Steyer,NA,"The question we've got here across the board is, can we afford to do the kinds of things that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are pushing?

Amy Klobuchar,(CROSSTALK),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,582

Amy Klobuchar,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,female,6,1,608
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So I have been very strong on these judges.

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the Judiciary Committee, look at the judges that I recommended to President Obama, people like Mimi Wright, who is a superstar, and Susan Richard Nelson. Look who I've put in as the first openly gay marshal in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs.",Candidate,female,6,1,613
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that know-how, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learned from when President Obama was in, and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges.",Candidate,female,6,1,614
Judy Woodruff,NA,"A follow-up to Mayor Buttigieg. Beyond a pledge not to overturn Roe v.

Amna Nawaz,NA,"Yes, sir, Afghanistan. As vice president, what did you know about the state of the war? And do you believe that you were honest with the American people about it?",Moderator,female,6,1,630
Joe Biden,NA,"The reason I can speak to this -- it's well-known, if any of you followed it, my view on Afghanistan -- I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report. I said there was no comprehensive policy available. And then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation-building notion we set about.",Candidate,male,6,1,631
Joe Biden,NA,"Rebuilding that country as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an antiterrorism policy with a very small footprint that, in fact, only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America.",Candidate,male,6,1,632
Joe Biden,NA,"The first thing I would do as president of the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home, entered into a negotiation with the Taliban. But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism.",Candidate,male,6,1,633
Joe Biden,NA,That's been my position from the beginning. That's why I think Secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon weren't happy with me.,Candidate,male,6,1,634
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Mr. Biden, the question was about your time in the White House, though.",Moderator,female,6,1,635
Joe Biden,NA,I'm talking about the White House.,Candidate,male,6,1,636
Amna Nawaz,NA,"In that Washington Post report, there's a senior national security official who said that there was constant pressure from the Obama White House to produce figures showing the troop surge was working, and I'm quoting from the report here, ""despite hard evidence to the contrary."" What do you say to that?",Moderator,female,6,1,637
Joe Biden,NA,"Since 2009, go back and look. I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon. The only reason I can speak to it now is because it's been published. It's been published thoroughly. I'm the guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it. And I argued against it constantly.",Candidate,male,6,1,638
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Senator Sanders, you had your hand up.",Moderator,female,6,1,639
Amna Nawaz,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,640
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, in all due respect to my -- Joe, Joe, you're also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq. What we need to do is, I think, rethink -- and the Washington Post piece was very educational -- what we need to rethink is the entire war on terror.",Candidate,male,6,1,641
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We have lost thousands of our own men and women, brave soldiers. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries. It is time right now that we bring this world together to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes which are causing these wars.",Candidate,male,6,1,642
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Senator Sanders, you do often point to your vote against the war in Iraq as evidence of your judgment on foreign policy, but you did vote for the war in Afghanistan. And as recently as 2015, you said you supported a continued U.S. troop presence there. Was that support a mistake?",Moderator,female,6,1,643
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, only one person, my good friend, Barbara Lee, was right on that issue. She was the only person in the House to vote against the war in Afghanistan. She was right. I was wrong. So was everybody else in the House.",Candidate,male,6,1,644
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But to answer your question, I don't think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 3 a.m. in the morning or desert your long-time allies like the Kurds. I think you work with the international community. You remove all troops over a period of time, a short period of time, within one year.",Candidate,male,6,1,645
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in this war, but I want to ask about your decision-making if you were elected commander-in-chief. You have pledged to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan within your first year as president, but the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country.",Moderator,female,6,1,646
Amna Nawaz,NA,So should you as president still withdraw all those U.S. troops if the country could once again become a haven for terrorists?,Moderator,female,6,1,647
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We're going to leave one way or the other. The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course, that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement.",Candidate,male,6,1,648
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But, you know, the other day, I was reunited with somebody that I'd served with over there. And the thing we were marveling at is how long it's been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago, and we're still there.",Candidate,male,6,1,649
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity, the exact same kind of thing, by the way, that we actually had in Syria holding the line before the president yanked it out, leading to the road to chaos.",Candidate,male,6,1,650
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars. And I'm glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned, not only because of what she's talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11. But right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage to take an up-or-down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place.",Candidate,male,6,1,651
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And when I am president, any time, if I am forced to deploy troops into war, any time we seek an authorization, it will have a three-year sunset, so that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up-or-down vote.",Candidate,male,6,1,652
Amna Nawaz,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",Moderator,female,6,1,653
Amna Nawaz,NA,Tim?,Moderator,female,6,1,654
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thanks, Amna.",Moderator,male,6,1,655
Tim Alberta,NA,"Moving to health care, an issue that voters tell us every day is still the number-one priority for them, Senator Sanders, you've spent plenty of time discussing and defending the merits of your Medicare for all plan. But the reality is that if Republicans retain control of the U.S. Senate or even if Democrats win back a narrow Senate majority, your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass Congress.",Moderator,male,6,1,656
Tim Alberta,NA,"So the question, Senator, is, if Congress rejects your plan and the American people are looking to you for leadership on this issue, are there smaller specific measures that you would take immediately to expand coverage and decrease costs as president?",Moderator,male,6,1,657
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, Tim, at a time when we're spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, when 87 million people are uninsured or underinsured, when 30,000 people are dying each year because they don't get to a doctor when they should, and when a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have, you know what? I think we will pass a Medicare for all single-payer system, and I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office.",Candidate,male,6,1,658
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, to answer your question, I think when we go out to the American people and tell them that right now we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, for example, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as is charged in this country, when the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing aids, and does it at a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about, you know what? We're going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind us.",Candidate,male,6,1,659
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Sanders.",Moderator,male,6,1,660
Tim Alberta,NA,"Vice President Biden, I'd like to bring you in. You spent an awful lot of time 10 years ago trying to pass a bill far less ambitious than what Senator Sanders is talking about here. Is he being realistic?",Moderator,male,6,1,661
Joe Biden,NA,"I don't think it is realistic, but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. Remind everybody, 20 million people got insurance who didn't have it before. All people with pre-existing conditions were able to be covered. I could go on. We didn't get all that we wanted.",Candidate,male,6,1,662
Joe Biden,NA,"But now that it's been exposed, that taking it away has such dire consequences, I've added to the Obamacare plan the Biden initiative, which is a public option, Medicare if you want to have Medicare, reducing significantly the price of drugs, deductibles, et cetera, by -- made by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $750 billion, and making sure that we're able to cover everyone who is, in fact, able to be covered. Put your hand down for a second, Bernie, OK?",Candidate,male,6,1,663
Joe Biden,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,664
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Just waving to you, Joe.",Candidate,male,6,1,665

Bernie Sanders,NA,Saying hello.,Candidate,male,6,1,667
Joe Biden,NA,"I know. So, look, it covers everybody. It's realistic. And most importantly, it lets you choose what you want. Here you have 160 million people who negotiated their health care plans with their employer, like many of you have. You may or may not like it. If you don't like it, you can move into the public option that I propose in my plan. But if you like it, you shouldn't have -- you shouldn't have Washington dictating to you, you cannot keep the plan you have.",Candidate,male,6,1,668

Bernie Sanders,NA,It is exactly true.,Candidate,male,6,1,675
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"No, that's not right.",Candidate,female,6,1,676
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And but -- thank you. And, by the way, Joe, under your plan, you know, you asked me how are we going to pay for it? Under your plan, I'll tell you how we're paying for it right now. The average worker in America, their family makes $60,000 a year. That family is now paying $12,000 a year for health care, 20 percent of their income. Under Medicare for all, that family will be paying $1,200 a year, because we're eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending this byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate health care plans.",Candidate,male,6,1,677

Tim Alberta,NA,Forty-five seconds for Vice President Biden.,Moderator,male,6,1,683
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm the only guy that's not interrupted here, all right? And I'm going to interrupt now. It costs $30 trillion. Let's get that straight, $30 trillion over 10 years. Some say it costs $20 trillion. Some say it costs $40 trillion.",Candidate,male,6,1,684
Joe Biden,NA,"The idea that you're going to be able to save that person making $60,000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. Sixteen percent of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me, you're going to add 84 percent more and there's not going to be higher taxes? At least before he was honest about it.",Candidate,male,6,1,685
Bernie Sanders,NA,Joe...,Candidate,male,6,1,686
Joe Biden,NA,It's going to increase personal taxes. There are going to be...,Candidate,male,6,1,687
Bernie Sanders,NA,"That's right, we are going to increase personal taxes. But we're eliminating premiums, we're eliminating co-payments, we're eliminating deductibles, we're eliminating all out-of-pocket expenses, and no family in America will spend more than $200 a year on prescription drugs.",Candidate,male,6,1,688

Joe Biden,NA,It's the first time I did this.,Candidate,male,6,1,697
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"OK, that's true. I'll say this. First of all, Bernie, I promise, when I am your president, I will get our pharmaceutical bills done. And we have worked together on this time and time again. And I agree with you on that.",Candidate,female,6,1,698
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But where I disagree is, I just don't think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option, to bring the cost down. And, yes, it does bring the costs down immediately for 13 million people, and then we'll expand coverage to 12 million people.",Candidate,female,6,1,699
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"But here's the political problem. This fight that you guys are having isn't real. Your fight, Bernie, is not with me or with Vice President Biden. It is with all those -- bunch of those new House members, not every one by any means, that got elected in that last election in the Democratic Party. It is with the new governor, Democratic governor of Kentucky, that wants to build on Obamacare.",Candidate,female,6,1,700
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And the way I look at it, if you want to bridge -- build -- if you want cross a river over some troubled waters, you build a bridge, you don't blow one up. And I think that we should build on the Affordable Care Act.",Candidate,female,6,1,701

Tim Alberta,NA,"All right. Forty-five seconds, Senator Sanders.",Moderator,male,6,1,711
Bernie Sanders,NA,"All right. My fight, Amy, is not with the governor of Kentucky. My fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, with the greed and corruption of the insurance industry. These guys last year made $100 billion in profit and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight.",Candidate,male,6,1,712
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The day has got to come -- and Joe is not talking about it, Amy is not talking about it -- the day has got to come, and I will bring that day about, when we finally say to the drug companies and the insurance companies, the function of health care is to provide it for all of our people in a cost-effective way, not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies.",Candidate,male,6,1,713
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Warren...",Moderator,male,6,1,714
Tim Alberta,(CROSSTALK),NA,Moderator,male,6,1,715
Tim Alberta,NA,"We'd like -- we'd like to bring you into this discussion. The same question to you that I posed to Senator Sanders, if Congress rejects a Medicare for all proposal and you're the president, are there smaller specific measures that you could pursue with bipartisan support to decrease costs and expand coverage?",Moderator,male,6,1,716
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So this is about costs. It's about costs on middle-class families. Last year, 36 million Americans didn't have a prescription filled because they couldn't afford it. And those are people with health insurance, as well. People who can't do the co-pays, people who can't do the deductibles, people who find out that the drug is not covered.",Candidate,female,6,1,717
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So here's how I approach this. I want to do the most good I can for the most people as quickly as possible. On day one, I'm going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs, like EpiPens and insulin, and bring down those prices. The president can do that -- I love saying this -- all by herself. And I will do it. That's going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars.",Candidate,female,6,1,718
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And then in the first 100 days, because I found a way to pay for full health care coverage for everyone without raising taxes on middle-class families...",Candidate,female,6,1,719
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,male,6,1,720
Elizabeth Warren,NA,... I'm going to make available to people for a full health care coverage for 135 million people. It will be at no cost at all. And they can opt into that system.,Candidate,female,6,1,721
Tim Alberta,NA,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,6,1,722
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"For others, it will be at a low cost. We have got to start moving and move fast.",Candidate,female,6,1,723

And the crew that follows me can tell you, there's not one line I go through that I don't have at least a half a dozen people come up and hug me and say, can you help me?

Tom Steyer,NA,"So when I think about the gift that I'd like to give -- and I've seen that, too.

There is cruelty to working people, there is cruelty to seniors.",Candidate,male,6,1,773
Tom Steyer,NA,"And so the gift that I would like to give everyone on this stage, which was the original question, is the gift of teamwork.

How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together, not by tearing each other down, but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America?

Judy Woodruff,NA,"Welcome back to the PBS NewsHour Democratic debate with Politico. And now it's time for closing statements. Each have 60 seconds, beginning with Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,6,1,778
Tom Steyer,NA,"I'm different from everybody else on this stage, and here's why. I'm running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people. And for the last 10 years, that's exactly what I've been doing, taking on unchecked corporate power.",Candidate,male,6,1,779
Tom Steyer,NA,"That's why I'm for term limits, because if we're going to have bold change, then we need new people in charge and new ideas. I'm the only person on this stage who's built a large, multibillion-dollar international business. I know how to grow prosperity. I can take on Mr. Trump on the economy and beat him.",Candidate,male,6,1,780
Tom Steyer,NA,"I'm the only one on this stage who said climate is my number-one priority. It's a crisis we have to deal with, but it's also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good-paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where it's so essential.",Candidate,male,6,1,781
Tom Steyer,NA,"So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold, beat Mr. Trump on the economy, and solve our climate crisis, I can deliver. And I'm asking for your vote.",Candidate,male,6,1,782
Judy Woodruff,NA,Mr. Yang. I'm sorry. My apology for interrupting.,Moderator,female,6,1,783
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,784
Judy Woodruff,NA,Mr. Yang?,Moderator,female,6,1,785
Andrew Yang,NA,"I know what you're thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?",Candidate,male,6,1,786
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,787
Andrew Yang,NA,"Our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser-focused on solving the real problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know. Our country is falling apart.",Candidate,male,6,1,788
Andrew Yang,NA,"Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We're seeing record high levels of depression and suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger.",Candidate,male,6,1,789
Andrew Yang,NA,"Our way of life is changing faster than ever, and the simple fact is this. Our politicians in D.C. succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington, D.C., today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions?",Candidate,male,6,1,790
Andrew Yang,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,791
Andrew Yang,NA,"We need to get the money out of D.C. and into your hands, the hands of the American people. Join us at yang2020.com and help us rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy to work for us.",Candidate,male,6,1,792
Andrew Yang,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,793
Judy Woodruff,NA,Thank you. Senator Klobuchar?,Moderator,female,6,1,794
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"We have had quite a debate tonight, but I want to debate Donald Trump. This primary comes down to some simple questions. Who has the best ideas, the best experience? Mostly, who can beat Donald Trump, and how will she do it?",Candidate,female,6,1,795
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So Donald Trump built his fortune on, over time, over $413 million that he got from his dad. My grandpa, he was an iron ore miner, a union member, who worked 1,500 feet underground, and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a community college. That's my family trust.",Candidate,female,6,1,796
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I figure if you are given opportunity, you don't go into the world with a sense of entitlement. You go into it with a sense of obligation, an obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself.",Candidate,female,6,1,797
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Our politics right now, because of Donald Trump, are toxic. We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails, join me. We will win at amyklobuchar.com.",Candidate,female,6,1,798
Judy Woodruff,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,6,1,799
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,800
Judy Woodruff,NA,Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,female,6,1,801
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"So the nominee is going to have to do two things: defeat Donald Trump and unite the country as president. It's a tall order. And in order to do it, we're going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side.",Candidate,male,6,1,802
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multigenerational coalition. And I am seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic Party before but belong here now because they're definitely not on board with what's going on in the Trump White House.",Candidate,male,6,1,803
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I am asking you to join me, to vote for me, to caucus for me, and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion, but by belonging.",Candidate,male,6,1,804
Pete Buttigieg,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,805
Judy Woodruff,NA,Senator Warren?,Moderator,female,6,1,806
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Did you call my name?,Candidate,female,6,1,807
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"This is a dark moment in America, and yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope. All three of my brothers served in the military. They're all retired. They're all back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Two are Republicans. But you know what unites my three brothers? Amazon. They are furious that Amazon reported $10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes.",Candidate,female,6,1,808
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"My brothers are part of why America is ready to root out corruption and fight back. And that gives us a base to work from. America is ready for a two cent wealth tax. It's supported by Republicans, Democrats, and independents. And it lets us invest in all of our children.",Candidate,female,6,1,809
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"America is ready to expand Social Security payments and disability payments by $200 a month. And we can do it. You know, someone asked what this would mean. You just give somebody $200 a month, they asked me this in a town hall. And a lady who wanted it said, you know what it will mean to me? It will mean I can get a prescription filled and I can still buy toilet paper the same week. That's where Americans are right now.",Candidate,female,6,1,810
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I am not working for millionaires and billionaires. I'm here to work for the tens of millions of people across this country who are ready to build an America that won't just work for those at the top, but that will work for everyone.",Candidate,female,6,1,811
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Thank you, Senator.",Moderator,female,6,1,812
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,813
Judy Woodruff,NA,Senator Sanders?,Moderator,female,6,1,814
Bernie Sanders,NA,"For 45 years, Americans have been listening to great speeches. And at the end of the day, the average American worker is not making a nickel more than he or she did in real wages over those 45 years.",Candidate,male,6,1,815
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The truth is that real change always takes place -- real change -- always takes place from the bottom on up, never from the top on down. And that is why in this campaign I am so proud that we have over a million volunteers. We have some of the strongest grassroots organizations. We have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in American history.",Candidate,male,6,1,816
Bernie Sanders,NA,Please join the political revolution at berniesanders.com. Let's defeat Trump. Let's transform this country. Thank you.,Candidate,male,6,1,817
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,6,1,818
Judy Woodruff,NA,"And finally, Vice President Biden.",Moderator,female,6,1,819
Joe Biden,NA,I want to thank everyone listening seven days out from Christmas. Thank you very much.,Candidate,male,6,1,820
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, we all have big progressive plans. And the question is, who can deliver on those plans? And it seems to me, we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly. Who has the best chance, the most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump? Who is the one who's most likely to do that?",Candidate,male,6,1,821
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate in states like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other states?",Candidate,male,6,1,822
Joe Biden,NA,"And thirdly, who can deliver legislatively? That requires you to look at our records. I have a significant record of getting significant things done, from Violence Against Women Act to the chemical weapons treaty, in foreign and domestic policy alike.",Candidate,male,6,1,823
Joe Biden,NA,"And so I think asking those questions, I believe, as you would expect, that I'm the most qualified to answer those three questions. But most of all, we've got to level with the American people. Don't play games with them. Tell them the truth and be authentic.",Candidate,male,6,1,824
Joe Biden,NA,"God bless you all, and may you have a great, great holiday season. And thank you guys for doing this, as well.",Candidate,male,6,1,825
Judy Woodruff,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,6,1,826
Judy Woodruff,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,6,1,827
Judy Woodruff,NA,"Thank you very much. And that concludes the PBS NewsHour-Politico debate. I do want to thank my colleagues here at the moderator table, Tim Alberta of Politico, Amna Nawaz and Yamiche Alcindor of the PBS NewsHour.",Moderator,female,6,1,828
Judy Woodruff,NA,Thank you all for joining us. Please stick around and watch PBS for some analysis. Thank you to the candidates.,Moderator,female,6,1,829

Judy Woodruff,NA,"Dec 19, 2019 23:36 ET .EOF",Moderator,female,6,1,832
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Live from Drake University in Iowa, this is the CNN Democratic presidential debate, in partnership with the Des Moines Register. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, along with CNN's Abby Phillip and the Des Moines Register's chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.",Moderator,male,7,1,1
Abby Phillip,NA,The top six Democratic presidential candidates are in place. This is their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 presidential campaign. The Iowa caucuses are 20 days away.,Moderator,female,7,1,2
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.",Moderator,female,7,1,3
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"All right, so let's begin right now. Just this month, the United States and Iran were on the brink of war, which has reignited the debate over America's role in the world and which of you is best prepared to be commander-in-chief. So let's have the debate right now.",Moderator,male,7,1,4
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Sanders, why are you best prepared — the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?",Moderator,male,7,1,5
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Yes, I think my record speaks to that, Wolf. In 2002, when the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And I not only voted against the war, I helped lead the effort against that war.",Candidate,male,7,1,6
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Just last year, I helped, for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia, was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it. We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues.",Candidate,male,7,1,7
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.",Candidate,male,7,1,8
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war. Why are you the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?",Moderator,male,7,1,9
Joe Biden,NA,"I said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn't get inspectors into Iraq to stop what — thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake, and I acknowledged that.",Candidate,male,7,1,10
Joe Biden,NA,"But right — the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama, picked me to be his vice president. And once we — once we were elected president, he turned — and vice president, he turned to me and asked me to end that war.",Candidate,male,7,1,11
Joe Biden,NA,"I know what it's like to send a son or daughter, like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq, and that's why I do it very, very reluctantly. That's why I led the effort, as you know, Wolf, against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interests of the United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq. And it was a mistaken vote.",Candidate,male,7,1,12
Joe Biden,NA,But I think my record overall on everything we've done has been — I'm — I'm prepared to compare it to anybody on this stage.,Candidate,male,7,1,13
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden's vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake. So you both acknowledged mistakes. Why should the American people trust your judgment more?",Moderator,male,7,1,14
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, it's a little bit of a difference. On that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself, voted for it. Only Barbara Lee voted against it.",Candidate,male,7,1,15
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But what I understood right away, in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died. We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into health care and education and infrastructure in this country.",Candidate,male,7,1,16
Bernie Sanders,NA,Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.,Candidate,male,7,1,17
Wolf Blitzer,NA,Vice President Biden?,Moderator,male,7,1,18
Joe Biden,NA,"I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in.",Candidate,male,7,1,19
Joe Biden,NA,"The world, in fact, voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake. And from that point on, I've voted to — I moved to bring those troops home.",Candidate,male,7,1,20
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, you've publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg's experience when it comes to being commander-in-chief. Why is your time as a U.S. senator more valuable than his time as a U.S. naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan and as mayor?",Moderator,male,7,1,21
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Thank you, Wolf. And I have been very clear that I respect the mayor's experience very much in the military. I just have different experience.",Candidate,female,7,1,22
Amy Klobuchar,NA,I've been in the U.S. Senate for over 12 years. And I think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life-and-death issues and who has made decisions.,Candidate,female,7,1,23
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn't in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home.",Candidate,female,7,1,24
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Then I have dealt with every issue, from Afghanistan to keeping our troops with good health care after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with our education and with their jobs and also with their health care.",Candidate,female,7,1,25
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I think right now what we should be talking about, though, Wolf, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution. We just found out today that four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say: You must have an authorization of military force if you're going to go to war with Iran.",Candidate,female,7,1,26
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That is so important, because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I worked on for a significant period of time. As president, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath...",Candidate,female,7,1,27
Wolf Blitzer,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,7,1,28
Amy Klobuchar,NA,... to protect and defend our Constitution.,Candidate,female,7,1,29
Wolf Blitzer,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,male,7,1,30
Amy Klobuchar,NA,And I will mean it.,Candidate,female,7,1,31
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar. We're going to continue talking about who's best prepared to be commander-in-chief. Mayor Buttigieg?",Moderator,male,7,1,32
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9/11, on the war in Iraq. And there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates.",Candidate,male,7,1,33
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The next president is going to be confronted with national security challenges different in scope and in kind from anything we've seen before, not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. It's going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past. And for me, those lessons of the past are personal.",Candidate,male,7,1,34
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Warren, in our new CNN/Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours. Why are you best prepared to be commander-in-chief?",Moderator,male,7,1,35
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I believe the principal job of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. And I think that's about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world.",Candidate,female,7,1,36
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I've been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I've been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops, to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they've been promised, that they don't get cheated by giant financial institutions.",Candidate,female,7,1,37
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, I have three brothers who were in the military, and I know how much our military families sacrifice. But I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money.",Candidate,female,7,1,38
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door, and we need to cut our defense budget. We need to depend on all of our tools — diplomatic, economic, working with our allies — and not let the defense industry call the shots.",Candidate,female,7,1,39
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office. Why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as commander-in-chief?",Moderator,male,7,1,40
Tom Steyer,NA,"I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with businesses, and I understand how America interacts with other countries.",Candidate,male,7,1,41
Tom Steyer,NA,"And you asked what is the reason that the — the experience really counts, and to me, I believe that Sen. Warren made a great point. It isn't so much about experience, it's about judgment.",Candidate,male,7,1,42
Tom Steyer,NA,"If you've been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment.",Candidate,male,7,1,43
Tom Steyer,NA,"And if you look who had the judgment, it was a state senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a congresswoman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress.",Candidate,male,7,1,44
Tom Steyer,NA,"So I would say to you this: An outside perspective, looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we're looking for now. I agree with Sen. Warren. We are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we're spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget, and it's time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we're trying to do and how to do it.",Candidate,male,7,1,45
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all U.S. troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you've called for, as well. Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and, indeed, around the world. How would you prevent that from happening again?",Moderator,male,7,1,46
Bernie Sanders,NA,"O.K., I'm going to tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else.",Candidate,male,7,1,47
Bernie Sanders,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,7,1,48
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And that is — and I don't know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not. Maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes were the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. Both of those wars were based on lies. And right now, what I fear very much is we have a president who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.",Candidate,male,7,1,49
Bernie Sanders,NA,"To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together, and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.",Candidate,male,7,1,50
Wolf Blitzer,NA,Vice President Biden?,Moderator,male,7,1,51
Joe Biden,NA,"I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world, including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us. And it was working. It was working. It was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon.",Candidate,male,7,1,52
Joe Biden,NA,"And look what's happened. He went ahead — and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happen. We're now isolated. We're in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence.",Candidate,male,7,1,53
Joe Biden,NA,"We have lost our standing in the region. We have lost the support of our allies. The next president has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances, and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.",Candidate,male,7,1,54
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"So just to be clear, Vice President Biden, would you leave troops in the Middle East or would you pull them out?",Moderator,male,7,1,55
Joe Biden,NA,"I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we have — where we are now, small numbers of troops, and I think it's a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS.",Candidate,male,7,1,56
Joe Biden,NA,"What's happened is, now that he's gone ahead, the president, and started this whole process moving, what's happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We're in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region. And quite frankly, I think he's flat-out lied about saying the reason he went after — the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.",Candidate,male,7,1,57
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, what's your response?",Moderator,male,7,1,58
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home. I would do that. Some would remain for counterterrorism and training.",Candidate,female,7,1,59
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"In Syria, I would not have removed the 150 troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now, I would leave our troops there, despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump.",Candidate,female,7,1,60
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"At the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also asked them what their alternatives were. And they gave very vague, vague answers.",Candidate,female,7,1,61
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I asked them, where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was president? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people. Time and time again, you see that this president puts his own interests, his private interests, in front of our country's. I would put our country's interests first as commander-in-chief.",Candidate,female,7,1,62
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East, or bring them home?",Moderator,male,7,1,63
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on Earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take. But we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily.",Candidate,female,7,1,64
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Our keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools.,Candidate,female,7,1,65
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Now, look, I understand, there are people on this stage, when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about 5 more years, 10 more years. Shoot, Lindsey Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region.",Candidate,female,7,1,66
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Vice President Biden, is Sen. Warren right?",Moderator,male,7,1,67
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, I tell you what, there's a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition to put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror as well as failed states. Not us alone, 68 other countries.",Candidate,male,7,1,68
Joe Biden,NA,"That's how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.",Candidate,male,7,1,69
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan. Who's right?",Moderator,male,7,1,70
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what's going on right now is the president's actually sending more. The very president who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along — although we know that's not true — now has more troops going to the Middle East.",Candidate,male,7,1,71
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members. I remember walking with a friend of mine, another lieutenant I trained with, as we walked away, and his one-and-a-half-year-old boy was toddling after him, not understanding why his father wasn't turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had not to turn around and look at his boy one more time.",Candidate,male,7,1,72
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm's way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander-in-chief.",Candidate,male,7,1,73

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Eighty-seven million people have no health care or are uninsured or underinsured. We got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight.",Candidate,male,7,1,75
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The American people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State Department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.",Candidate,male,7,1,76
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"We're going to get to everyone, but, Vice President Biden, you criticized President Trump's decision to kill the Iranian general, Soleimani, without first going to Congress. Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?",Moderator,male,7,1,77
Joe Biden,NA,I ran the first time as a 29-year-old kid against the war in Vietnam on the grounds that the only way to take a nation to war is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people.,Candidate,male,7,1,78
Joe Biden,NA,"And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, including special forces, we — there's no way you negotiate or have been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions to be able to defeat them or contain them. If you don't, we end up being the world's policeman again.",Candidate,male,7,1,79
Joe Biden,NA,They're going to come to us. They've come to us before. They'll come to us again. So it's a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries. It's fundamentally the requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.,Candidate,male,7,1,80
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Mr. Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action. So would the Biden doctrine be different?",Moderator,male,7,1,81
Joe Biden,NA,"No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress, House, and Senate, and signed by the president. That was the authority. It does not give authority to go into Iran. It gave authority to deal with these other issues.",Candidate,male,7,1,82
Wolf Blitzer,NA,Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,male,7,1,83
Pete Buttigieg,NA,That authorization needs to be replaced.,Candidate,male,7,1,84
Joe Biden,NA,Exactly. And we tried to.,Candidate,male,7,1,85
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When we lost troops in Niger, there were members of Congress who admitted they didn't even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaida and 9/11. And often, Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now, thanks to Democrats in Congress, that's changing. But the reality is, year after year, Congress didn't want to touch this, either, because it was so politically difficult.",Candidate,male,7,1,86
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm's way, often on deployment after deployment, then we've got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up-or-down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am president, anytime — which I hope will never happen — but anytime I am compelled to use force and seek that authorization, we will have a three-year sunset, so that the American people are included ...",Candidate,male,7,1,87

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Well, imminent threat. But we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the Constitution provides and that is what as commander-in-chief I will do.",Candidate,female,7,1,91
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But I just want to be clear. Everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war. But the question is, when and how do you plan to get out of it?",Candidate,female,7,1,92
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"You know, on the Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, you know, we've just turned the corner and now it's all going to be different. And then what happens? It's all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we've just turned the corner.",Candidate,female,7,1,93
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We've turned the corner so many times, we're going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It's not enough to say some day we're going to get out. No one on the ground, none of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It's time to get our combat troops home.",Candidate,female,7,1,94
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Mr. Steyer, would a President Steyer use military force as a deterrent? And if not, under what circumstances would you take military action?",Moderator,male,7,1,95
Tom Steyer,NA,I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows is that there is no real strategy that we're trying to accomplish in what we're doing in the Middle East.,Candidate,male,7,1,96
Tom Steyer,NA,"Obviously, Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis, from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years, including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that, in fact, there was no strategy. There was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.",Candidate,male,7,1,97
Tom Steyer,NA,"So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden. To do it, we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that, as we do that, we're confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about.",Candidate,male,7,1,98
Tom Steyer,NA,"But at the same time, there's a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value-driven coalition-building that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we should do should follow into that strategy. And it's just not happening in Washington, D.C.",Candidate,male,7,1,99
Abby Phillip,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you'd face as president is the threat of nuclear weapons. Last week, President Trump said, quote, ""As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon."" Would a President Buttigieg make that same promise?",Moderator,female,7,1,100
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons will, of course, be a priority, because it's such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal.",Candidate,male,7,1,101
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"By gutting the Iran nuclear deal — one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran — by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.",Candidate,male,7,1,102
Pete Buttigieg,NA,Now — yes?,Candidate,male,7,1,103
Abby Phillip,NA,Continue.,Moderator,female,7,1,104
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"In order to get that done, we've got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA. That first letter ""J"" stood for ""Joint."" We can't do this alone, even less so now after everything that has happened.",Candidate,male,7,1,105
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world, and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear-armed country.",Candidate,male,7,1,106
Abby Phillip,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, to be clear, would you allow Iran to become a nuclear power, yes or no?",Moderator,female,7,1,107
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, we've got a lot of other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world.",Candidate,male,7,1,108
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Despite this president's coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. We've got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from states, from stateless potential terrorist actors, or anywhere else around the world.",Candidate,male,7,1,109

Abby Phillip,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, if you become president, it's very possible there won't be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin. Given that, how would you prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon?",Moderator,female,7,1,111
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I would start negotiations again. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting — Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.",Candidate,female,7,1,112
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"So what I would do is negotiate. I would bring people together, just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a president that sees this as a number-one goal.",Candidate,female,7,1,113
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And in answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place. I think there are changes you can make to the agreement that are sunset, some changes to the inspections, but overall, that is what we should do.",Candidate,female,7,1,114
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran, because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen: enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon.",Candidate,female,7,1,115
Abby Phillip,NA,"Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea. President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times. President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions. Would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?",Moderator,female,7,1,116

Joe Biden,NA,"I would be putting what I did as vice president — I met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make — their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before — and you reported it extensively, Wolf — about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons, that we would — and when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, that's a threat to us, I said, we're going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.",Candidate,male,7,1,118

Tom Steyer,NA,"No. It's very clear that if we're going to do something with North Korea, we're going to have to do it in concert with our allies, that meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get.",Candidate,male,7,1,126
Tom Steyer,NA,"But this is a classic situation where the United States' idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let's face it. Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we've had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran, whereas, in fact, what worked with President Obama was an alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"The heart and soul of our disastrous trade agreements — and I'm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China — is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, $1 or $2 an hour.",Candidate,male,7,1,135
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase ""climate change"" in it.

Elizabeth Warren,NA,But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting. And they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut really don't have enforcement on workers' rights.,Candidate,female,7,1,144

Pete Buttigieg,NA,"He will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just re-joining the Paris Climate Accord, that's table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today.",Candidate,male,7,1,194

Abby Phillip,NA,"Let's now turn to — let's now turn to an issue that's come up in the last 48 hours. Sen. Sanders, CNN reported yesterday that — and Sen. Sanders, Sen. Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?",Moderator,female,7,1,196
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it. And I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States.",Candidate,male,7,1,197
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Go to YouTube today. There's a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the United States. In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Sen. Warren. There was a movement to draft Sen. Warren to run for president. And you know what, I said — stayed back. Sen. Warren decided not to run, and I then — I did run afterwards.",Candidate,male,7,1,198
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the United States? And let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination, I hope that's not the case, I hope it's me.",Candidate,male,7,1,199

Abby Phillip,(LAUGHTER),NA,Moderator,female,7,1,206

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record. So, can a woman beat Donald Trump?",Candidate,female,7,1,208

Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I hear that. People have said it. That's why I've addressed it from this stage. I point out that you don't have to be the tallest person in the room. James Madison was 5'4"". You don't have to be the skinniest person in the room. You don't have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent.",Candidate,female,7,1,235

Bernie Sanders,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,7,1,261
Bernie Sanders,NA,But I don't know that that's the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is — let's — does anybody in their right mind think that a woman cannot be elected president?,Candidate,male,7,1,262
Bernie Sanders,NA,"That's — nobody believes that. Of — Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman can't win? Of course, a woman can win.",Candidate,male,7,1,263
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But the real question is, how do we beat Trump?",Candidate,male,7,1,264
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And the only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement...",Candidate,male,7,1,265

Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And here's the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have out-performed men candidates in competitive races. And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.",Candidate,female,7,1,273
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, don't deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, ""Could a Catholic win?""",Candidate,female,7,1,274

Abby Phillip,NA,"Donald Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare, including the protections for pre-existing conditions. We all know that each of you vigorously opposes that. Still, there are some questions about what each of you would do.",Moderator,female,7,1,289
Abby Phillip,NA,"Sen. Sanders, you have consistently refused to say exactly how much your Medicare For All plan is going to cost. Don't voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars?",Moderator,female,7,1,290
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, what I will tell you is Medicare For All, which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo.",Candidate,male,7,1,291
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Medicare For All will end the absurdity of the United States paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general, while we have 87 million uninsured — uninsured and underinsured, and while 30,000 people die each year.",Candidate,male,7,1,292
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Under Medicare For All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4 percent tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year.",Candidate,male,7,1,293
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We save money, comprehensive health care, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exists in our dysfunctional system.",Candidate,male,7,1,294
Abby Phillip,NA,"Vice President Biden, does Sen. Sanders owe voters a price tag on his health care plan?",Moderator,female,7,1,295
Joe Biden,NA,"I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we're going to do and what it's going to cost. And a 4 percent tax on income over $24,000 doesn't even come close to paying for between $30 trillion, and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over 10 years.",Candidate,male,7,1,296
Joe Biden,NA,"That's doubling the entire federal budget per year. There's a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, reinstate — rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and in fact make sure that we, in the process, reduce the cost of — of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the — subsidize it further, and make it everybody — available to everyone.",Candidate,male,7,1,297
Joe Biden,NA,Here's the deal. That costs a lot of money. That costs $740 billion over 10 years. I lay out how I'd pay for that.,Candidate,male,7,1,298
Abby Phillip,NA,Sen. Sanders?,Moderator,female,7,1,299
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is, when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about are workers paying on average 20 percent of their incomes for health care. That is insane.",Candidate,male,7,1,300
Bernie Sanders,NA,"You've got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. We're spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.",Candidate,male,7,1,301
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Look, we have talked about health care for all — in this country — for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health care industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide health care to all through a Medicare For All single-payer program.",Candidate,male,7,1,302
Bernie Sanders,NA,"It won't be easy, but that is what we have to do.",Candidate,male,7,1,303
Bernie Sanders,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,7,1,304
Joe Biden,NA,You can do it without that. You can do it without Medicare For All. You can get the same place.,Candidate,male,7,1,305

Abby Phillip,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, your response?",Moderator,female,7,1,307
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Yeah. Sen. Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time. And we agree on this. But what I don't agree with is that we — his position on health care.",Candidate,female,7,1,308
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"This debate isn't real. I was in Vegas the other day and someone said ""Don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.""",Candidate,female,7,1,309
Amy Klobuchar,NA,That's the problem. Over two-thirds of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate are not on the bill that you and Sen. Warren on on. You have numerous governors that are Democratic that don't support this. You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in as speaker.,Candidate,female,7,1,310
Amy Klobuchar,NA,The answer is a non-profit public option. The answer is — the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health. I have a plan for that.,Candidate,female,7,1,311
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And then, finally, what should we do about long-term care? The elephant that doesn't even fit in this room. We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance. We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums.",Candidate,female,7,1,312
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"My own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him. He's in assisted living. He got married three times — whole other story — so there isn't much there.",Candidate,female,7,1,313

Amy Klobuchar,NA,People trying to help their parents.,Candidate,female,7,1,321
Abby Phillip,NA,Sen. Warren?,Moderator,female,7,1,322
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So we need to start with what's happening in America. People are suffering. I'll just pick one: 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription, this is what they needed to get well, and they couldn't afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said it's either groceries or this prescription.",Candidate,female,7,1,323
Elizabeth Warren,NA,My approach to this is we've got to get as much as help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one thin dime.,Candidate,female,7,1,324
Elizabeth Warren,NA,What I can do are the things I can do as president on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I'll use the power that's already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV-AIDS drugs. Let's get some relief to those families. And I will defend the Affordable Care Act.,Candidate,female,7,1,325
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I've got a plan to expand health care, but let's keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do health care, but we're going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut health care for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I'll take our side of the argument any day. We're going to beat him on this.",Candidate,female,7,1,326
Abby Phillip,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Warren. Vice President Biden?",Moderator,female,7,1,327
Abby Phillip,(APPLAUSE),NA,Moderator,female,7,1,328
Joe Biden,NA,"The proposal I lay out does, in fact, limit drug cost. It sets up — it allows all the drug companies — excuse me, it allows you to — Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. And by the way, there's mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.",Candidate,male,7,1,329
Abby Phillip,NA,Mr. Steyer?,Moderator,female,7,1,330
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, we've had this conversation on this stage so many times. Everybody on this stage believes that affordable health care is a right for every single American. Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for health care as any other advanced country in the world. And it makes no sense and the government has to step in.",Candidate,male,7,1,331
Tom Steyer,NA,"I do happen to agree with Vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option. But the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.",Candidate,male,7,1,332
Tom Steyer,NA,"That's what I'm talking about. How do we get back government of, by, and for the people? How do we actually break...",Candidate,male,7,1,333

Abby Phillip,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,7,1,336
Abby Phillip,NA,"Sen. Sanders, your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade, an unprecedented level of spending not seen since World War II. How would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country?",Moderator,female,7,1,337
Bernie Sanders,NA,"No, our plan wouldn't bankrupt the country. And, in fact, it would much improve the well-being of working-class families and the middle class.",Candidate,male,7,1,338
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.",Candidate,male,7,1,339
Bernie Sanders,NA,"What we will do through a Medicare for all single-payer program is substantially lower the cost of health care for employers and workers, because we end the $100 billion a year that the health care industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend in administrative — the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.",Candidate,male,7,1,340
Bernie Sanders,NA,Health care is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing health care for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same.,Candidate,male,7,1,341
Abby Phillip,NA,Sen. Klobuchar?,Moderator,female,7,1,342
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act. And if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipedream, you have to show how you're going to pay for it.",Candidate,female,7,1,343
Amy Klobuchar,NA,And I would also note practically that the Affordable Care Act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the United States. So I think the answer is to build on it.,Candidate,female,7,1,344
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And, yes, I think you should show how you're going to pay for things, Bernie. I do. This president is treating people out there like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos the way he is adding to our debt.",Candidate,female,7,1,345
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit, by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit.",Candidate,female,7,1,346
Abby Phillip,NA,"Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.",Moderator,female,7,1,347

Abby Phillip,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, your time is up. Let's move on to the next question.",Moderator,female,7,1,353
Amy Klobuchar,NA,... and we can get the money to pay for things.,Candidate,female,7,1,354
Abby Phillip,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you're selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it, yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don't want it, and force them to pay for it. How is that truth in advertising?",Moderator,female,7,1,355
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, it's making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look, the individual mandate was an important part of the ACA because the system doesn't work if there are free riders.",Candidate,male,7,1,356
Pete Buttigieg,NA,What I'm offering is a choice. You don't have to be in my plan if there's another plan that you would rather keep. And there's no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver health care for all.,Candidate,male,7,1,357
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And my plan is paid for. Look, our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. Now, we've got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, it's almost invariably Republican presidents who have added to the deficit, a trillion dollars under this president. And it's why everything I've put forward — from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we're going to make in infrastructure to dealing with climate change — is fully paid for.",Candidate,male,7,1,358
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When it comes to health care, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade. No small sum. But not the $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion that we're hearing about from the others. All you've got to do is two things, both of them are commonsense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn't even need it.",Candidate,male,7,1,359
Abby Phillip,NA,Sen. Warren?,Moderator,female,7,1,360
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans, including Americans with insurance, who just can't even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, health care plans that we have, and these plans are paid for.",Candidate,female,7,1,361
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"The problem is that plans like the mayor's and like the vice president's is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. But they're a small improvement. And that's why it is that they cost so much less, because by themselves, they're not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can't afford to get them filled.",Candidate,female,7,1,362
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1 percent, to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes, we can have them pay. And we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide health care for all our people.",Candidate,female,7,1,363

Abby Phillip,NA,Mayor Buttigieg?,Moderator,female,7,1,365
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small. We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate.",Candidate,male,7,1,366
Pete Buttigieg,NA,This would be a game-changer. This would be the biggest thing we've done to American health care in a half-century. Let's measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives.,Candidate,male,7,1,367
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And, yes, we're taking on cost. On prescription drugs, we'll have an out-of-pocket cap, even if you don't get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap. And here's why it's got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they've got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits?",Candidate,male,7,1,368
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It makes no sense medically because most of us don't experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don't come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly.",Candidate,male,7,1,369
Abby Phillip,NA,Thank you.,Moderator,female,7,1,370

Abby Phillip,NA,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Sen. Warren, your response?",Moderator,female,7,1,372
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, the numbers that the mayor is offering just don't add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and co-pays and uncovered expenses and fees. You can't cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about.",Candidate,female,7,1,373
Elizabeth Warren,NA,The way we have to approach this is we've got to build this and we've got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families.,Candidate,female,7,1,374
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But we have to be willing to work together. We can let people experience what health care is like when it's you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner, with no insurance company standing in the middle.",Candidate,female,7,1,375

You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn't get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance. Then, a few months ago, you said, no, you're going to wait a while to get there.",Candidate,female,7,1,379
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I think that was some acknowledgment that maybe what we're talking about is true. And I don't buy that it's not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 that your premiums will be cut in half, which is what the nonprofit public option will do.",Candidate,female,7,1,380
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And as you talk, Mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 cosponsors. As president, I can get it done.

What happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like Des Moines?""",Moderator,female,7,1,384

Bernie Sanders,NA,"But here is the issue. Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is: the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies.",Candidate,male,7,1,386

Abby Phillip,NA,Mr. Steyer?,Moderator,female,7,1,390
Tom Steyer,NA,"I just want to emphasize what Sen. Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders said, it's clear. There are two problems. We're spending way too much because corporations own the system and we're not negotiating against those corporations.",Candidate,male,7,1,391
Tom Steyer,NA,And we've given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That's all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering.,Candidate,male,7,1,392
Tom Steyer,NA,"Sen. Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we're going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That's why I'm for term limits. We need to redo Washington, D.C., and...",Candidate,male,7,1,393

Joe Biden,NA,"Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices. You don't have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If, in fact, they charge more than we set the price for, they can — they can, in fact — we can — people can import from abroad, assuming that it is — it is — it is safe.",Candidate,male,7,1,398
Joe Biden,NA,"We, in fact — it's only yellow, Wolf, OK? And we can, in fact, do all of this and still provide people the option to stay — the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers. If they don't like it, or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.",Candidate,male,7,1,399
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Let's talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now. Prescription drug prices in 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs alone. That's about $60 billion more than they paid a decade ago.",Moderator,male,7,1,400
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Warren, you've called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike. Why does it make sense for the government — for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows?",Moderator,male,7,1,401
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So, let's do this both ways. What I also have said is, I'm just going to use the power that is available and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin.",Candidate,female,7,1,402
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We already have the legal authority with the president to do that. The president just hasn't picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV-AIDS drugs. That's going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately.",Candidate,female,7,1,403
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But, you know, there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90 percent of drugs, that are not under patent. They're generic drugs. But the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up.",Candidate,female,7,1,404
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So my view is, let's give them a little competition. The government lets contracts for all kind of things. They let contracts to build buildings. They let contracts to build military weapons. Let's let the contracts out. Put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices.",Candidate,female,7,1,405
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don't have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.",Candidate,female,7,1,406
Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs?",Moderator,male,7,1,407

Amy Klobuchar,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,female,7,1,409

Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes, as a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two-thirds of my income. Many families don't have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly, as we've seen in Iowa over the last few years. How will you prioritize accessing quality, affordable child care in your first 100 days in office?",Moderator,female,7,1,419
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It makes no sense for childcare to cost two-thirds of somebody's income. We've to drive it to 7 percent or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty.",Candidate,male,7,1,420
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they're working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense, and it must change, and we shouldn't be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality.",Candidate,male,7,1,421
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education, as well as childcare writ large. We can do that.",Candidate,male,7,1,422
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And until we do, this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap. Because when somebody like the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.",Candidate,male,7,1,423
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Sen. Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare. Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning?",Moderator,female,7,1,424

And yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment, it is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald's workers.",Candidate,male,7,1,433
Bernie Sanders,NA,"We need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of a few countries that does not have universal high-quality affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right.

Joe Biden,NA,"There should be free universal infant care, but here's the deal. You know, I was a single parent, too. When my wife and daughter were killed, my two boys I had to raise. I was a senator, a young senator. I just hadn't been sworn in yet. And I was making $42,000 a year.",Candidate,male,7,1,438

Joe Biden,NA,"And that's why there are several things we do. When I triple the amount of money for Title I schools, every child, 3, 4, and 5 years old, will, in fact, have full schooling. They'll go to school and after-school programs, which will release some of the burden.",Candidate,male,7,1,440

Wolf Blitzer,NA,"Sen. Warren, a Senate trial is expected to keep you in Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa Caucuses here. How big of a problem is that for you as you're making your closing pitch to voters here?",Moderator,male,7,1,488
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. We have an impeachment trial. I will be there because it is my responsibility.",Candidate,female,7,1,489
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That is what lies at heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first. Not the American people. Not the interests of the United States of America. Not even helping Ukraine defend against Russia.",Candidate,female,7,1,490
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats we're not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That's why we're here.",Candidate,female,7,1,491
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Let's turn now to the climate crisis. Here in Iowa parts of the state remain under water after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $2 billion in damages. Today many Iowans are still displaced from their homes.",Moderator,female,7,1,492
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you have talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding. But what do you do about farms and factories that simply can't be moved?",Moderator,female,7,1,493
Pete Buttigieg,NA,That's why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. Seeing it in Iowa. We have seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once-in-a-millennium flood. Then two years later had to do the same thing.,Candidate,male,7,1,494
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical and this is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes, to adapt, to make sure communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other.",Candidate,male,7,1,495
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"But we also have to ensure that we don't allow this to get any worse. And if we get right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them, whether we're talking about farmers or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them...",Candidate,male,7,1,496

Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"... to clarify, what do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated?",Moderator,female,7,1,499
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency. And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories, and that disproportionately happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward.",Candidate,male,7,1,500
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.",Moderator,female,7,1,501
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Mr. Steyer, what's your response?",Moderator,female,7,1,502
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, what you're talking about is what's called managed retreat. It's basically saying we're going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control. And it's unbelievably expensive. And of course we'll come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble.",Candidate,male,7,1,503
Tom Steyer,NA,But this is why climate is my number one priority. And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate.,Candidate,male,7,1,504
Tom Steyer,(APPLAUSE),NA,Candidate,male,7,1,505
Tom Steyer,NA,"I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can't breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely. But I also know this, we're going to create millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. It's going to be the biggest job program in American history.",Candidate,male,7,1,506
Tom Steyer,NA,"So I know we have to do it. I know we can do it. And I know that we can do it in a way that makes us healthier, that makes us better paid, and is more just.

Tom Steyer,NA,... priority one.,Candidate,male,7,1,509
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you're the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. So are you the right messenger on this topic?",Moderator,female,7,1,510
Tom Steyer,NA,"I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy. And over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the Giving Pledge to give most of my money away while I'm alive. And for 12 years I have been fighting the climate crisis.",Candidate,male,7,1,511
Tom Steyer,NA,"I have beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I have stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully.",Candidate,male,7,1,512
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,7,1,513

Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,7,1,515
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Sen. Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipeline and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review. Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can't overturn?",Moderator,female,7,1,516
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. And the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands, and offshore drilling. That will help us get in the right directions. I'll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution.",Candidate,female,7,1,517
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We should see this for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.",Candidate,female,7,1,518
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on health care, on all of the issues that matter to us.",Candidate,female,7,1,519
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Thank you, Sen. Warren.",Moderator,female,7,1,520
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Sen. Klobuchar, some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all-out ban on fracking. You haven't. Why not?",Moderator,female,7,1,521
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, first of all, I would note that I have 100 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters. And that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems.",Candidate,female,7,1,522
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And one thing that hasn't been raised, by the way, is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones.",Candidate,female,7,1,523
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. It's a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral.",Candidate,female,7,1,524
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar. And that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050, to get to by 2030 to a 45 percent reduction.",Candidate,female,7,1,525
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And I want to add one thing that no one's really answered. When we do this, we have to make sure that we make people whole.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let's be clear. If we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now — not easy stuff— the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy.",Candidate,male,7,1,538
Bernie Sanders,NA,We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need.,Candidate,male,7,1,539
Bernie Sanders,NA,This is of course a national crisis. I introduced legislation to indicate it's a national crisis. We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. That's what the Green New Deal does. That's what my legislation does. And that is what we have to do.,Candidate,male,7,1,540
Brianne Pfannenstiel,NA,"Vice President Biden, your response?",Moderator,female,7,1,541
Joe Biden,NA,"My response is, back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill — and check PolitiFacts (sic); they said it was a game-changer. I've been fighting this for a long time. I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to — to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America.",Candidate,male,7,1,542
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away. And the way we act right away is, immediately if I'm elected president, I'll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration which were taken down. That's 12 billion gallons of gasoline — barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately.",Candidate,male,7,1,543
Joe Biden,NA,"And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what's already happened, we should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads, makes sure that we're in a position where we have — that every new highway built is a green highway, having 550,000 charging stations.",Candidate,male,7,1,544
Joe Biden,NA,"We can create — and this is where I agree with Tom — we can create millions of good-paying jobs. We're the only country in the world that's ever taken great crisis and turned it into great opportunity. And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa, by making them the first group in the world to get to net zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right — there's more to say, but I know my time is...",Candidate,male,7,1,545
Abby Phillip,NA,A key part of your mission in this primary is going to be to prove to Democratic voters that you're strong enough to take on Donald Trump. Each of you face unique challenges in doing that.,Moderator,female,7,1,546
Abby Phillip,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you say you've had trouble earning the support of black voters because you're unknown. But you've been campaigning for a year now and polling shows you with next to no black support, support that you'll need in order to beat Donald Trump. Is it possible that black voters have gotten to know you and have simply decided to choose another candidate?",Moderator,female,7,1,547
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The black voters who know me best are supporting me. It's why I have the most support in South Bend. It's why, among elected black officials in my community who have gotten into this race, by far most of them are supporting me.",Candidate,male,7,1,548
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And now, nationally, I am proud that my campaign is co-chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders, from Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County.",Candidate,male,7,1,549
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Now, the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted. And I never will. The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that I'm perfect. It's because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can, not from the luxury of — of a debate or a television panel or a committee room but on the ground, issues from poverty to justice in policing.",Candidate,male,7,1,550
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And I'm proud to say we have been nationally recognized for our work as a race-informed city on delivering greater economic justice, that we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing.",Candidate,male,7,1,551
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Of course there is a much longer way to go, in my community and around the country. But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work.",Candidate,male,7,1,552
Abby Phillip,NA,"Sen. Sanders, you call yourself a Democratic Socialist. But more than two-thirds of voters say they are not enthusiastic about voting for a socialist. Doesn't that put your chances of beating Donald Trump at risk?",Moderator,female,7,1,553
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Nope, not at all. And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is corrupt. He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud.",Candidate,male,7,1,554
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Now, when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Donald Trump as a businessman received $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing.",Candidate,male,7,1,555
Bernie Sanders,NA,"My Democratic Socialism says health care is a human right. We're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We're going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $20 million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren. We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company. That is what Democratic Socialism is about and that will win this election.",Candidate,male,7,1,556
Abby Phillip,NA,"Mr. Steyer, you've spent more than $100 million of your own dollars on television ads. How do you convince voters that you're more than just your money?",Moderator,female,7,1,557
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president. He's going to run on the economy. He's already told Americans last month in Florida, ""You don't like me and I don't like you, but you're all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.""",Candidate,male,7,1,558
Tom Steyer,NA,So let's be clear. I started a business by myself in one room. I didn't inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion-dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power.,Candidate,male,7,1,559
Tom Steyer,NA,But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy. And I have the experience and the expertise to show that he's a fake there and a fraud.,Candidate,male,7,1,560
Tom Steyer,NA,"Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have 30 years of international business experience. I can beat Trump on the economy. We're going to have to beat him on the economy. And I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage.",Candidate,male,7,1,561

Pete Buttigieg,(LAUGHTER),NA,Candidate,male,7,1,564
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It was not the biggest part of my career. But I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on, and guided that community through a historic transformation.",Candidate,male,7,1,565
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When, at the beginning of the decade, I took office, we were described as a dying city. I'm ready to take on Donald Trump because, when he gets to the tough talk and the chest-thumping, he'll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve.",Candidate,male,7,1,566

How are you going to inspire Democratic voters with a message of pragmatism?",Moderator,female,7,1,577
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Our voters, actually all Americans, have seen now a number of years of a guy that has, I think, told over 15,000 lies. He is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric. And I think what Americans want is something different.",Candidate,female,7,1,578

And what I'm going to say is this. ""My grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the iron ore mines, saved money in a coffee can in the basement, to send my dad to a two-year community college.

George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Candidates, welcome. Vice President Biden, the first question is for you. In the last few days, you've been saying that Democrats will be taking too big a risk if they nominate Senator Sanders or Mayor Buttigieg, but they came out on top in Iowa. What risks did the Iowa Democrats miss?",Moderator,male,8,1,2
Joe Biden,NA,"Oh, they didn't miss anything. It's a long race. I took a hit in Iowa and I'll probably take a hit here. Traditionally Bernie won by 20 points last time. And usually it's the neighboring senators that do well. But no matter what, I'm still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together. And so it's a simple proposition. It doesn't matter whether it's this one or the next. I've always viewed the first four encounters, two primaries, and two caucuses as the starting point. And so that's how I view it.",Candidate,male,8,1,3
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Why are Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg too big a risk for Democrats?,Moderator,male,8,1,4
Joe Biden,NA,"Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. We're going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernie's labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that's the label that the President's going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he's a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He's a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we'll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.",Candidate,male,8,1,5
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Sanders, let me give you the chance to respond first. President Trump certainly thinks this label socialism will work. At the State of the Union, he said, ""Socialism destroys nations. He's never going to let socialism destroy American healthcare."" And before the Super Bowl, he joked was Sean Hannity about your honeymoon in Moscow. Those hits are going to keep coming if you're the nominee. Why shouldn't Democrats be worried?",Moderator,male,8,1,6
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Because Donald Trump lies all the time. It doesn't matter what Donald Trump says, it's a sad state of affairs, it really is. He will say terrible things about Joe, he has [inaudible] ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth, about Amy, about anybody else who was up here. But I think George, that at the end of the day, the way we defeat Donald Trump and everybody up here by the way, is united. No matter who wins this damn thing, we're all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,8,1,7
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they don't believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain. And we got to bring young people into the political process. I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6,000 votes. What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30%. If we do that nationally, we're going to defeat Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,8,1,8
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"But Senator, let me follow up there and then we'll move on. But back in Iowa, the turn out this year was about the same as it was in 2016. Far below what it was in 2008 when President Obama won.",Moderator,male,8,1,9
Bernie Sanders,NA,"That's true. And that's the disappointment and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters. But if there is a good spot, a good aspect about that campaign, is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama's historic 2008 campaign. And if that happens nationally, we're going to win and defeat Trump.",Candidate,male,8,1,10
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Before I move on to Mayor Buttigieg, let me just ask, is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a democratic socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket?",Moderator,male,8,1,11
Bernie Sanders,NA,I'm not.,Candidate,male,8,1,12
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Klobuchar.,Moderator,male,8,1,13
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Bernie and I work together all the time. But I think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out. And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in 2016, I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully, Donald Trump's worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else. And I would submit that that is me.",Candidate,female,8,1,14
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mr. Steyer, is socialism [inaudible]",Moderator,male,8,1,15
Tom Steyer,NA,"I don't think there's any question, George, that after this week there's a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected. And I don't think there's any question, but that the only way that we're going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means we're going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos. If you can't do that, then we can't beat Donald Trump in November and we can't choose a candidate who can't do that. And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada. That's what it's going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. Someone who can pull, as Amy said, everything together in every single way we're divided.",Candidate,male,8,1,16
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Andrew Yang and Senator Warren then Mayor Buttigieg.,Moderator,male,8,1,17
Andrew Yang,NA,"First, let me say America, it's great to be back on the debate stage. Thank you. I'm so excited, I want to give every American $1,000 a month. George, the entire capitalism, socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models, they did not foresee technology getting stronger, more powerful, capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye. We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs? Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides. What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family's way of life. Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness, life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, clean air, and clean water, how our kids are doing. The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our family's lives.",Candidate,male,8,1,18
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Warren, you reportedly said back in 2018, ""I'm a capitalist to my bones."" Senator Sanders says, ""I'm not."" Is that your biggest difference with Senator Sanders?",Moderator,male,8,1,19
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Oh, Bernie and I have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on. But there's fundamental question about how we bring our party together. We have to think about it in new ways. People across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, understand that we've got a government right now that works great for those at the top. Works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and it's not working so great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is. Corruption, and that's what we can run on. We bring our party together.",Candidate,female,8,1,20
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It's an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption. We're the Democrats, we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that. They hate the corruption as well. My anti-corruption plan, good for Republicans and Democrats. That's not only how we bring our party together. That's how we're going to win in November.",Candidate,female,8,1,21
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, early in the campaign you said that the word socialism has lost its power, it's mostly lost its meaning. Do you believe that or worry it could be a potent weapon in a general election?",Moderator,male,8,1,22
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I'm not interested in the labels. I'm not interested in what Republicans are going to say. I'm interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually, finally turn the page. In order to win, yes, but also in order to govern. This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadn't even thought of a few years or decades ago. And politically, we're facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump. So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar. Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification, when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says, if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count. A politics that says, it's my way or the highway.",Candidate,male,8,1,23
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Are you talking about Senator Sanders?,Moderator,male,8,1,24
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Yes. Because we've got to bring as many people as we can into this process. Look, all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that it's going to take in order to win. But the process of actually proving it is now underway. And now it comes to New Hampshire, a state that thinks for itself, is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging. Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on their side if we don't agree 100% of the time.",Candidate,male,8,1,25
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Sanders, your response.",Moderator,male,8,1,26
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Needless to say, I've never said that, but let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class. The way you bring people together, Republicans, independents, Democrats, progressives, conservatives, you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we're not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, they're going to start paying their fair share of taxes. That's what the American people want. And I'll tell you something else, the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry they're not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire. That's how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump.",Candidate,male,8,1,27
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you just heard Senator Sanders make healthcare the center of his piece. Do you think his healthcare plan can bring people together?",Moderator,male,8,1,28
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I think there's a better way. It's true, the American people are ready. There's a historic majority right now, even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago. There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription. Just so long as we don't command people to accept a public plan if they don't want to. That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. My point is, what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants. Yes, higher wages, doubling the rate of unionization in this country, making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, delivering healthcare and college affordability. But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people. That is not only what we need in order to win, it's what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done.",Candidate,male,8,1,29
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Vice President Biden, how do you unify the country?",Moderator,male,8,1,30
Joe Biden,NA,"Look, Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All. But Bernie says, and he says he wrote the damn thing, but he's unwilling to sell us with the damn thing's going to cost. The fact that we're in New Hampshire, very levelheaded group of people, look at the numbers. How much is it going to cost? Who's going to pay for it? It will cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes aren't going to go up is just crazy. When they did it in Vermont, what happened? They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14% tax on withholding. And they finally did away with it. So how much is it going to cost? When you ask Bernie that, and I'll ask him again tonight sometime, and if you ask Bernie that, he says, ""Go figure, I don't know, we'll find out.""",Candidate,male,8,1,31
Joe Biden,NA,"I think that was on CBS. He said, "" We'll find out."" Or something to that effect. Imagine you're going to unite the country walking into the Congress, ""I got this bill. It's going to require Medicare for everybody. I can't tell you how much it's going to cost. We'll find out later and it's likely to be double whatever ... everything we spent in the federal government."" Who do you think is going to get that passed? I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed, getting every Democratic vote. I know how hard it is.",Candidate,male,8,1,32
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Sanders.,Moderator,male,8,1,33
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, for a start, what the studies show, if we do what Joe wants, we'll be spending some $50 trillion on healthcare over the next 10 years. That's the status quo, Joe. That's what Health and Human Services says. [crosstalk] And what we have got to do Joe, and what we have got to do is understand, simple question, Joe, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money. Substantial, be much less expensive than your plan. And we will expand Medicare to include dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aides and home health care as well.",Candidate,male,8,1,34
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Vice President Biden, 30 second response, then Senator Klobuchar after that.",Moderator,male,8,1,35
Joe Biden,NA,30 second-,Candidate,male,8,1,36
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Yeah, 30 second-",Moderator,male,8,1,37
Joe Biden,NA,"30 second response. My proposal gives you a choice. You're going to be covered. You have Medicare if you want it, you turn [inaudible] we're going to restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare. We're going to reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, et cetera. And it cost a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years. I tell you how I'm going to pay for it. I'm going to raise the capital gains rates, you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is. That'll pay for it, that's $800 billion. But here's the deal, the fact is that it's going to cost ... Bernie's plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America.",Candidate,male,8,1,38
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Klobuchar.,Moderator,male,8,1,39
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I keep listening to this same debate, and it is not real. It is not real, Bernie, because two thirds of the Democrats in the Senate are not on your bill and because it would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. And let me say what else, Elizabeth wants to do it in two years. And Pete, while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said, henceforth, forewith, indubitably, affirmatively, you are for Medicare for All for the ages. And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position, looking at things and sticking with them. I have long believed that the way that we expand healthcare to more people and bring down premiums is by building on the Affordable Care Act, with a nonprofit public option. That is the best way to do it.",Candidate,female,8,1,40
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"And practically look at this, the Affordable Care Act is now nearly 10 points more popular than the President of United States. So why would we talk about blowing it up? What we need to do is build on it. Mental health care, addiction, longterm care, those are the things that would make it better for everyone.",Candidate,female,8,1,41
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Warren and Mayor Buttigieg, you were both invoked. I want you each to respond and then go back to Senator Sanders.",Moderator,male,8,1,42
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is, 36 million Americans last year couldn't afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance. I want everyone in here to think about what that means. They were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor, a doctor looked at it and says that's serious enough to write a prescription. They walked out and then said, it's either that or groceries. It's that or pay them rent on time. We have got to change our healthcare system. The way [no audio or video 00:18:34] Help to the most people as quickly as we can. How about we start with what a president can do, I love saying this, all by herself. On day one, I will defend the Affordable Care Act and I will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV, AIDS, drugs and EpiPens.",Candidate,female,8,1,43
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We can start making healthcare better for Americans from the beginning, but we have to agree to do that. We are the Democrats, we are on the side of expanding healthcare. When we come up against Donald Trump, the team that has been trying to take away healthcare from millions of people, what's going to matter most is we are the people on the side of those who need healthcare across this country. That's who Democrats are.",Candidate,female,8,1,44
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, I want you to respond to that, but also take on the argument at the beginning from the Vice President, you don't have the right experience to be president.",Moderator,male,8,1,45
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Sure. Well, first of all, just to be clear, the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American. And as to experience, I just bring a different perspective. Look, I freely admit that if you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, you've got your candidate, and of course it's not me. The perspective I'm bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington, D.C. Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation. Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room. We need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past. Turn the page and bring change to Washington before it's too late.",Candidate,male,8,1,46
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Vice President Biden, there's his answer.",Moderator,male,8,1,47
Joe Biden,NA,"The politics of the past I think were not all that bad. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act, which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it, I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage. So I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad. What happened? What is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning.",Candidate,male,8,1,48
Joe Biden,NA,"... Happened, what is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning. It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways, and there's ways to do that, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done, and can lead the free world at the same time.",Candidate,male,8,1,49
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg respond, and then Senator Sanders.",Moderator,male,8,1,50
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Those achievements were phenomenally important, because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment. And this moment is different. The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we're seeing coming out of China, to cybersecurity, and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago. And here at home, we're seeing things like gig work, transform what it means to be a worker in America, in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago. We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back. We have to be ready to turn the page, and change our politics before it's too late. And I'm seeing everywhere I go, not just fellow Democrats, but a striking number of independents, and, what I like to call future former Republicans ready to join in that historic American majority to turn the page.",Candidate,male,8,1,51

And there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people. There was courage from Doug Jones, our friend of Alabama, who took that tough vote. There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took it very, very difficult vote. There was courage, as I read today, about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman being escorted out of the White House, what he did took courage.

Bernie Sanders,NA,"Look, at the end of the day, we got to ask ourselves a very simple question, whether it's healthcare in fact, or anything else. Why are we the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people? Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured? 30,000 die because they don't get to a doctor on time, and 500,000 people going bankrupt, for what reason? Because they have cancer or heart disease, or Alzheimer's. We got to ask that question, why is it why? Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years, and here is the answer. If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, you're going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies. You're going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, ""Sorry, we're not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country."" But at the end of the day, there's no way around it. You may want to nibble around the edges, but ultimately, you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies, to tell Wall Street, to tell the insurance companies, to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us, not a handful of special interests.",Candidate,male,8,1,60
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, wrap this up, and then-",Moderator,male,8,1,61
Tom Steyer,NA,"I have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate, and they're all right, everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the Republican party, and a million times better than Donald Trump. That is not the question in front of us today. The question in front of us today is, how are we going to beat Donald Trump? You were in the Clinton campaign in 1992, and the mantra was, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Well, if you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, he's saying those words, ""It's the economy, stupid."" I trust every one of these people a million times more, but we're going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy, because if you listen to him, he's crowing about it every single day, and he's going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid. And that's the issue here. It is not about who has the best healthcare plan. All the healthcare plans are better, a million times better.",Candidate,male,8,1,62
Tom Steyer,NA,"The question is, who can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump? Who can take down Mr. Trump, because he's the real threat to the country? And let me say, you have to have experience to take him down. This is not a question of he's a nice guy who's going to listen. We need people with experience. That's why I'm worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy, and take him down on the debate stage, or we're going to lose. And that's actually the issue in front of democratic voters. I have heard this debate so many darn times, and I love all these people, and they're all right. If we win, we can get the right thing, Bernie. I am with you. If we win, we can get the right thing, Pete, and Amy, but we got to win, or we are in deep trouble, and we keep not talking about the facts.",Candidate,male,8,1,63
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Mayor Pete.,Moderator,male,8,1,64
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Here's how we're going to win. We're going to force this president to stand on that debate stage, next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood, in the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for, but turns his back on. We're going to put up somebody who's not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast, and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party. We're going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn, and remind him what serving this country is really about. If we want to beat this president, we've got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past, and unify this country around a new and better vision. That's how we're going to win. And when I talk about exhaustion, this is important, because I got to tell you, the American people, from outside of Washington, we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division, and the dysfunction there.",Candidate,male,8,1,65
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of Congress, and the Senate are doing. It's not. But, the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it. I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that I've spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester, and in the other states that we're in. And the important thing for the American people to remember, is this is 2020, it's an election year. And if the Senate was the jury before, you are the jury now. The American people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president, and on the senators in the GOP who protected him.",Candidate,male,8,1,66
Andrew Yang,NA,"Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump's victory. Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems, and we're making a mistake when we act like he is.",Candidate,male,8,1,67
Pete Buttigieg,NA,That's right.,Candidate,male,8,1,68
Andrew Yang,NA,"He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years, and decades. And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease. Most Americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose, I lose, you lose, I lose for years. And you know who's been losing this entire time? We have. Our communities have. Our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet. That's why Iowa, traditional swing state, went to Trump by almost 10 points. That's why Ohio, a traditional swing state is now so red, that I'm told we're not even going to campaign there.",Candidate,male,8,1,69
Andrew Yang,NA,"So, these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens. We've automated away four million manufacturing jobs, and counting. We're closing 30% of New Hampshire stores and malls, and Amazon, the force behind that, is literally paying zero in taxes. These are the changes that Americans are seeing and feeling around us every day, and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems, we will not just defeat Donald Trump in the fall, but we'll actually be able to move our communities forward.",Candidate,male,8,1,70
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"I know we're going to hear a lot more on this, but we're going to move on.",Moderator,male,8,1,71
Speaker 1,NA,"Thank you George. Good evening candidates. We come to you, of course, just 48 hours after the acquittal of President Trump. A process that has certainly crystallized the divide in our country. Senator Warren, want to start with you. You have said that on day one of your presidency, one of your first orders of business will be to order your justice department to launch new investigations into the Trump Administration. After a grueling impeachment, and what is likely to be a polarizing election, is investigating President Trump the best way to try to unify the country?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,72
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I think no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. We watched on Wednesday as Republicans, all but one locked arms to protect him from impeachment, but we need to reestablish the rule of law in this country. I believe in an independent commission, in our justice department that investigates crimes committed by our own government. It is an important part of accountability. It is an important part for every administration, that we hold ourselves accountable to the American people. Look, people around this country are losing faith in our government. They're losing faith that government works for them. They see a government that just works great if you're rich. It works great if you're a lobbyist. It works great if you're a corporate executive, but they see themselves and their children with less and less and less, and we could do something about it.",Candidate,female,8,1,73
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"It's not enough simply to talk about the future. We have to be willing to stand up to those who now control our government, and make that government instead work for us. We can do child care in this country for every baby. We can invest in our public schools. We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, but only if we are willing to take control of our government away from the giant corporations and billionaires, return it to the people. This is about our government. This is about our democracy. This is about our future.",Candidate,female,8,1,74
Speaker 1,NA,"Mr. Yang, you said that the notion of a leader quote, throwing the president before them in jail is not the way things are done here in the United States. It would make it quote, very hard for any party to govern sustainably moving forward. Does that mean that any alleged misconduct by the president or his administration should not be investigated?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,75
Andrew Yang,NA,"There are of course limits, and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office, but the fact is, if you look around the world, the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail, have generally been developing countries, and unfortunately that's a pattern that once you establish, is very, very hard to break. What's a more American tradition? We move the country forward. We don't focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office. Most Americans do not care about what a particular individual did, so much as they care about their family's wellbeing, their community, their town. That's where Americans focus wants. They want the American president. They want the present. Of course, the American president, sorry about that. They want the president to be focused on that, and that's where our attention should be. We should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries.",Candidate,male,8,1,76
Speaker 1,NA,Senator Sanders.,Moderator,unknown,8,1,77
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Along with Elizabeth and Amy, we sat for two weeks listening to the impeachment process, and here's what I think the horror and the danger of what happened was not only the acquittal of Trump, who in fact committed impeachable offenses, and obstructed Congress. It is the precedent that it set. The precedent that it set. And what that precedent is about now is in the future, you're going to have presidents who say, ""Hey, governor, you want highway money? You better support me, or you're not going to get it."" Because I am the president, I can do anything I want.",Candidate,male,8,1,78
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Hey, Congress, you want to investigate me? Don't be ridiculous. Who cares about the Congress? Who cares about the separation of powers? Who cares about the constitution of the president? I'm the President of the United States. I have all of the power, and I'm able to intimidate members of my own party. The saddest aspect of this whole thing, is you have Republicans in the Senate who knew better. They knew that Donald Trump is a crook. They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat, but they didn't have the guts, with the exception of Romney to vote against him. That is a sad day.",Candidate,male,8,1,79
Speaker 1,NA,Mr. Steyer.,Moderator,unknown,8,1,80
Tom Steyer,NA,"So, I did start the Need to Impeach movement in October of 2017. And my father was one of the people who prosecuted the Nazi war criminals after World War II. And that's part of the reason I started it. Because when you see something really wrong in the United States, you're supposed to stand up against it, and fight against it. And that's what I was doing. But he's been, the Republicans have rolled over, they've had a sham trial, they've refused to have witnesses. They've covered up the truth for the American people. And it doesn't matter anymore that he's a crook, and he's always been a crook, and he always will be a crook. Right now, what we have to do is we have to beat him in November, and we have to beat him because he's incompetent, and bad for the American people. And that's the case we have to make now.",Candidate,male,8,1,81
Tom Steyer,NA,"Is he a crook? I knew that two years ago. Is he going to be more of a crook, now that he believes he can get away with anything? Of course he is. But the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in November, and that's going to be based on what we can deliver for the American people. The fact that he's incompetent as a president, his economy isn't delivering for working people. The jobs don't pay enough for people to live on. We've got to take him down on the economy, and get them out of the White House as soon as possible.",Candidate,male,8,1,82
Speaker 1,NA,"Thank you Mr. Steyer. Impeachment is of course over. But Republicans in Congress have already started investigating vice president Biden's son, Hunter. Mayor Buttigieg, do you think that there's a danger for the democratic party to nominate a candidate who is still under the threat of investigation?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,83
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"No, and we're not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden, or vice president Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president. The vice president and I and all of us are competing. But we've got to draw a line here. And to be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing, that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term.",Candidate,male,8,1,84
Speaker 1,NA,Vice president Biden.,Moderator,unknown,8,1,85
Joe Biden,NA,"I thank my colleague for saying that. It is a diversion, but here's the deal. Whomever the nominee is, the president's going to make up lies about. He thinks he has free reign right now. One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what we're going to do and how we're going to do it. And by the way, Colonel Vindmen got thrown out of the White House, walked out. I think at the same time, he should have been pinning a medal on Vindmen, and not on rush Limbaugh. And I think we should all stand and give Colonel Vindmen a show of how much we supported him. Stand up and clap for Vindmen. Get up there. Who we are. That's who we are. We are not what Trump is.",Candidate,male,8,1,86
Speaker 1,NA,"Thank you Vice President Biden. The Democratic party's last presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders track record in the senate.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,87
Bernie Sanders,NA,I wasn't able to hear that question.,Candidate,male,8,1,88
Speaker 1,NA,"Okay sure. The democratic party's last presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders record in the senate, saying, ""Nobody likes him. Nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done."" Senator Klobuchar, you served with Senator Sanders in the Senate. Is he going to be able to get the support? Not if you like him, but is he going to be able to get the support that he needs from Republicans?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,89
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I like Bernie just fine. We actually have worked together on a number of things, including pharmaceuticals. We actually had a vote late at night one time, Klobuchar/ Sanders amendment to bring in less-",Candidate,female,8,1,90
Bernie Sanders,NA,I thought it was Sanders/Klobuchar?,Candidate,male,8,1,91
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Nope, nope, nope, it was not, it was not. To bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, since in this great state of New Hampshire, like in Minnesota and Vermont, we can see Canada from our porch. And we ended up getting I think 14 Republican votes. And they might not have noticed what was happening late at night, but we got those. And I think that it is just an example of what we need to do here, because I've been listening to this discussion. I agree with my colleagues, we must unite, but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for America. That is what we must do, and that means taking on a president, if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on.",Candidate,female,8,1,92
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Taking on a president that literally went down to Mar-a-Lago after he signed that Republican tax bill, and looked at all his friends and said, ""You just got a lot richer."" That is exhibit A for those carpenters in Pennsylvania, and those dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and those dock workers that I met with in Michigan. That is an exhibit A, and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country, some of whom voted for Donald Trump, that we have something better to offer. That we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill, and put that money into their childcare, into their healththere.",Candidate,female,8,1,93
Speaker 1,NA,"Senator, just a quick yes or no. Do you think that Senator Sanders will be able to get Republican support in order to pass his bills?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,94
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"That, I don't know. I know we did on that bill, but the point is, I think we're better off with someone that has the receipts. Someone that has actually won big time with Republicans and independents, and I'm the only one up on this stage, you can check it out, that has consistently won in red congressional districts. Not once, not twice, but three times. And when I did this, I didn't just do it for me. I led a ticket. I've flipped the state house every single time, because I have a way of working with people, that I think should be valued here as we look at these candidates, and it's one of the reasons that I got the New York Times endorsement, along with Elizabeth, and that I got the endorsements of the three major papers here in New Hampshire, which is the Union Leader, the Seacoast papers, and the Keene Sentinel. I think that matters. Read those editorials, and you will get a sense of what I'm about.",Candidate,female,8,1,95
Speaker 1,NA,Thank you Senator. Senator Sanders.,Moderator,unknown,8,1,96

Bernie Sanders,NA,I did. We're very proud of that.,Candidate,male,8,1,99
Amy Klobuchar,NA,There we go.,Candidate,female,8,1,100
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But, let me just say this. I think the question started off with Secretary Clinton's critique. I think, quite honestly, as we face one of the great political crises facing America, our job is to look forward and not back to 2016. And I hope that Secretary Clinton and all of us can come together, and move in that direction. Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say...",Candidate,male,8,1,101
Bernie Sanders,NA,"-in that direction. Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say that in my own great state of Vermont, if my memory is correct, Amy, I got 25% of the Republican vote. And in fact, there were periods when I was in the House of Representatives, a number of years where I passed more amendments on the floor of the House in a bipartisan way than any other member of the House and that is when you bring people together on an issue. There are many conservative Republicans, for example, who are concerned about civil liberties, at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties. There are Republicans, as you know, who are concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs. There are ways that we can work with Republicans on issues where we have a common basis.",Candidate,male,8,1,102

Bernie Sanders,NA,Let's do that.,Candidate,male,8,1,104
Lindsey Davis,NA,David.,Moderator,female,8,1,105
David Muir,NA,"Lindsey, thank you. Good evening, all. I want to turn to America's role in the world and readiness to be commander-in-chief on day one. Just this week, you saw it, during the State of the Union, President Trump offered an indication of what he'll tout on the campaign trail. He celebrated the US air strike that killed top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani saying, ""Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.""",Moderator,male,8,1,106
David Muir,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, you're the only veteran standing on this stage and while there is still debate about whether or not there was an imminent threat, there is no debate about whether or not Soleimani was a bad actor who was responsible for the deaths of many Americans. Given what you know about Soleimani, if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike, would Soleimani have been dead or would he still be alive under your presidency?",Moderator,male,8,1,107
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"In the situation that we saw with President Trump's decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer. Look, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated. It's also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing. This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war, but it didn't start with the Soleimani strike. It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working. And it's time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war, that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve.",Candidate,male,8,1,108
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"By chance, just because I was traveling for the campaign, not long ago, I ran into somebody that I hadn't seen since we were both serving, hadn't seen since she was injured in an insider attack. And I saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a Wounded Warrior Project tee shirt that said, ""Some assembly required."" And when I asked her how she was doing, she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldn't save, tapped on the prosthetic and said the Navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment.",Candidate,male,8,1,109
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The people in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them. What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence, pay attention to the international security situation, consult with our allies, keep US politics out of it, and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harm's way if there is an alternative.",Candidate,male,8,1,110
David Muir,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, let me just press further on this though, because president Trump has signal in a general election campaign, he will celebrate his willingness to order that strike. I'm asking if your national security team came to you and presented you with the opportunity, would you take the strike?",Moderator,male,8,1,111
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It depends on the circumstances. It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be. That's my point. This is not an episode of 24. This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture. This president has insulted the intelligence community, but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified. And I don't think he even reads it.",Candidate,male,8,1,112
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And here we have a situation where the world, that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military, not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to Colonel Vindman, but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor. We deserve a better commander-in-chief.",Candidate,male,8,1,113
David Muir,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. I do want to take this to Vice President Biden next because we know that the Obama Administration was aware of the threat that Soleimani posed, so was the Bush Administration before it. I'm asking tonight as commander-in-chief though, would you have ordered the strike?",Moderator,male,8,1,114
Joe Biden,NA,"No. And the reason I wouldn't have ordered the strike, there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him. Look what happened, his America First policies made America alone. You cannot think of a time, David, and as long as you've been alive when NATO has said to the United States of America and to Iran, made a moral equivalence and said, both of you stand down. We are alone now, alone in that region of the world, without friends, without support, without allies.",Candidate,male,8,1,115
Joe Biden,NA,"And secondly, you saw what happened when that air raid, when those missiles were fired from Iran into Iraq at Al-Assad Airbase, 64 of our heroes were wounded. I don't know what I would've done if my son were still there. I would have been so damn angry. I don't know what I would've done. But here's what happened, they had received traumatic brain injury. What did the president say? He said, ""headaches,"" ""not bad,"" ""Headaches, that's all they are."" This guy doesn't deserve to be commander- in-chief for one more day.",Candidate,male,8,1,116
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice President, thank you, Senator Sanders, you have called this, ""assassinating a government official."" You would not have ordered the strike.",Moderator,male,8,1,117
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Right. Look, here is the danger, David, there are very bad leaders all over the world. Kim Jong-un in North Korea is probably responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of his people threatening all of Asia with nuclear weapons. You got Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia who is a terrible murderer, who murdered Khashoggi in cold blood and dismembered his body. You have Putin in Russia who has been involved in political assassinations of his enemies. You got Xi in China who has put a million Muslims into concentration camps.",Candidate,male,8,1,118
Bernie Sanders,NA,"You cannot go around saying you're a bad guy, we're going to assassinate you, and then you're going to have, if that happens, you're opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination. What we have got to do, which Trump does not understand, is strengthen the State Department and our diplomatic capabilities, not just the military. What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say, you know what, let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN, not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives.",Candidate,male,8,1,119
David Muir,NA,"Senator Sanders, thank you. This does take me to Afghanistan and to America's longest war. Senator Warren, you recently said quote, ""We have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, 'We've just turned the corner,' and then what happens? It's all the same. Someone new comes in and says, 'We've just turned the corner.' You said, ""So many say it. We're going in circles.""",Moderator,male,8,1,120
David Muir,NA,"We were on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq in recent months and the generals told us that the US needs some US presence on the ground, US special forces some presence to go after ISIS and the terrorists. If your commander-in-chief, would you listen to the generals or do they fall into the category of the generals you've mentioned before?",Moderator,male,8,1,121
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"No. Look, I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so I get the briefings from the generals on a regular basis. I've been to Afghanistan, to Iraq. I've been to Jordan. I've been throughout the region. I've been there with John McCain. I've been there with Lindsey Graham to ask the hard questions about what's happening, to ask our generals, to ask their generals to ask people who are on the ground. And the bottom line is, nobody sees a solution to this war. Nobody can describe what winning looks like. All they can describe is endless war.",Candidate,female,8,1,122
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And I realized there are people on this debate stage who are willing to say, yeah, we'll leave our troops there for five more years, for 10 more years. Lindsey Graham has said he's willing to leave troops for 100 more years. And yet, what has all these years of war brought us? Right now, the Afghan Government controls less than 60% of the land. People don't have faith in it. It's a corrupt government. The opium trade is higher than ever.",Candidate,female,8,1,123
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, we sent our troops in and they did their best. They were there for us, but we need to be there for them. And that means, not send our troops to do work that cannot be solved militarily. It is time to bring our combat troops home. It is time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan.",Candidate,female,8,1,124
David Muir,NA,"Senator Warren, I want to press you on this. You just said, ""combat troops.""",Moderator,male,8,1,125
Elizabeth Warren,NA,Yes.,Candidate,female,8,1,126
David Muir,NA,"So if the generals came to you and said, we need US Special Forces, some footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan, would you listen? Would you leave them?",Moderator,male,8,1,127
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I want to hear the plan, not just a, we need it now, we need it for the next day, we need it for the six months. And I want to know where our allies are. We all have an interest in dealing with terrorism and controlling terrorism, but that means it can't just be the United States waging endless war. That does not make us safer. It does not make the region safer. It does not make the world safer. We should work with our allies in managing terrorism, but we need to end this war in Afghanistan. We cannot wait five more years, or 10 more years, or until we turn the corner 10 more times. We need to bring our combat troops home.",Candidate,female,8,1,128
David Muir,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you. I want to take this to the Vice President because you have said of Senator Warren's comments before that the United States should get out of the Middle East. You have said, ""I quite frankly was surprised that I have never heard anyone say with any serious background in foreign policy that we should pull all troops out of the Middle East."" Is Senator Warren wrong on this?",Moderator,male,8,1,129
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm not sure what she, if she wants to pull all troops out of the Middle East, but if she does want to put all troops out of the Middle East, we saw what happens when that happened.",Candidate,male,8,1,130
Joe Biden,NA,"I helped put together a 61 nation group to take out ISIS by putting fewer than 5,000 forces along the Turkish border to see to it that they, and they lost 10,000, the Kurds, lost 10,000 lives. They defeated ISIS. They ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man I know very well, they've now, the guy running Turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a Democrat, and what happened? We pulled out and you saw what happened. You saw the end of the effort to be able to continue to contain, contain ISIS, number one.",Candidate,male,8,1,131
Joe Biden,NA,"Number two, close your eye, everybody. Remember what you saw on television. You saw a woman standing up there holding up her baby, Kurd, saying, ""Please don't leave us."" And our military women and men standing at, going out in their [inaudible] Humvees with their heads down ashamed of what they did. It didn't take a lot of men or men and women to do what needed to be done.",Candidate,male,8,1,132
Joe Biden,NA,"And with regard Afghanistan, now I can say it because it was made public, I was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in Afghanistan. The only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region. I've been in every part of Afghanistan, not in combat like my friend has, but in helicopter and/or on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president. Here's what I saw, there is no possibility of uniting that country, no possibility at all of making it a whole country. But it is possible to see to it that they're not able to launch more attacks from the region on the United States of America. That's a small footprint that we needed and I argued for that in the beginning.",Candidate,male,8,1,133
David Muir,NA,"You mentioned Mayor Buttigieg. And I do want to take this to you next, mayor. Given your finish in Iowa, you've come under increasing scrutiny, attacks from opponents on experience. We've heard that theme even right here tonight. You have said on the Iraq War, for example. ""I just don't believe there is any justification for that vote."" You said, ""It's the difference between tenure and judgment."" That it's the judgment that matters, not the time in Washington. Vice President Biden, as you know, voted yes. As commander-in-chief, do you believe your judgment would be better than the vice president's?",Moderator,male,8,1,134
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy. And looking forward, we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before. It's not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq, it's about preventing a war with Iran. And not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that we've been doing throughout, the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community.",Candidate,male,8,1,135
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"At a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats, in President Trump's imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators. It's a 17th century approach to keeping a place safe. What we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships, but defining a strategy to keep the American people safe from fundamentally new challenges.",Candidate,male,8,1,136
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice President, I'll let you respond to his argument on judgment.",Moderator,male,8,1,137
Joe Biden,NA,"I made a mistake and I said it 14 years ago. I trusted George Bush to keep his word. He said he was not going to go into Iraq. He said he was only using this to unite the United Nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what Saddam was doing. When we got elected, the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said, ""Joe, I want you to organize getting 156,000 troops out of Iraq."" I did that. I did that.",Candidate,male,8,1,138
Joe Biden,NA,"The other thing I want to point out too is that NATO is in fact going to crumble if we don't beat Trump. NATO is in real trouble. We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security. We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before. It wasn't just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States, coming into Europe. It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf. I know how to deal with them. I know every one of these world leaders by their first names. They call me. I talked to them and I believe I can get it done.",Candidate,male,8,1,139
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice President, thank you. Mr. Steyer, I do want to bring you in on this because I noticed in the last 24 hours you have an attack ad running here in New Hampshire with images of Mayor Buttigieg and you say over those images ""an untested newcomer."" But I wanted to ask you tonight on this readiness to be commander-in-chief, you share the stage with a veteran from Afghanistan, a vice president who was in the Situation Room. What makes you most qualified of all candidates on this stage to be commander-in-chief?",Moderator,male,8,1,140
Tom Steyer,NA,"Well, let me say this, I agree with Pete Buttigieg that it's about judgment not tenure. What we're hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how America should be the world's policemen. And what we've actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world. So when we're talking about our role in the world and commander-in-chief, we have abandoned a diplomacy. We don't have a strategy and we don't have allies.",Candidate,male,8,1,141
Tom Steyer,NA,"And actually this view of the world, that our response should be military is driven by our gigantic military complex and ignores the biggest problem that we face internationally in the world, which is climate change. And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes. It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries. So in fact, what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending $700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend $70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education.",Candidate,male,8,1,142
David Muir,NA,Mr. Steyer [crosstalk 00:17:13].,Moderator,male,8,1,143
Tom Steyer,NA,Let's talk about judgment here. [crosstalk 00:59:16].,Candidate,male,8,1,144
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice President, I'll give you 30 seconds to respond.",Moderator,male,8,1,145
Joe Biden,NA,"That's not what I said, I was part of the reason putting that deal together with Iran. I was there. I was involved in that. I was also part of the deal putting together the Paris Climate Accord. I brought in the Chinese. I was part of that. I've been part of every major initiative we've had relative to diplomacy. I have not argued for the placement of major numbers of US combat troops. I have said, along with the President of the United States, Barack Obama as his partner, I have said, we have to strengthen NATO to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them. Like we don't keep our commitments to the Kurds. We must keep our commitments when we make them. Otherwise, we have no power whatsoever.",Candidate,male,8,1,146
Joe Biden,NA,"And it's not about making sure we're policeman of the world. The only way not to become the policeman of the world is to have allies who will join us in dealing with failed States and terrorism. And it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesn't require large number of US troops, and I've never said that.",Candidate,male,8,1,147
Tom Steyer,NA,"Okay, can I respond to that, David?",Candidate,male,8,1,148
David Muir,NA,"Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, please.",Moderator,male,8,1,149
Tom Steyer,NA,Can I respond to [crosstalk 01:00:22].,Candidate,male,8,1,150
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let me say this if I might, like Joe and others, I also heard the arguments in terms of the war in Iraq from Bush, from Cheney, from John Bolton, from the whole administration. I listened very carefully and I concluded that they were lying through their teeth. And I not only voted against that war, but I help lead the opposition. And it saddens me so much. If you hear what I said, it's on YouTube, my fears about all the destabilization that would take place by the US invading Iraq. It's sad to me that, that is what happened.",Candidate,male,8,1,151
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But let me just pick up on a point that Tom made, which is absolutely right. Trump wants to build a wall around America. The problem is if we are going to deal with issues like climate change, not only do we in America have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, we have to lead the entire world. This is not an American issue. It's a global issue. We got to bring China and Russia and Brazil and Pakistan and India and every major country on earth into the fight against climate change.",Candidate,male,8,1,152
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And here is my dream, maybe it's a radical dream, but maybe just may be given the crisis of climate change, the world can understand that instead of spending $1.8 trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.",Candidate,male,8,1,153
David Muir,NA,"[crosstalk 00:20:02]. Senator Sanders, thank you. George, back to you.",Moderator,male,8,1,154

Devin Dwyer,NA,( silence).,Moderator,unknown,8,1,156
Devin Dwyer,NA,"And welcome back to Manchester, New Hampshire and the ABC News Democratic Debate. Thanks for joining us here on ABC News Live. I'm Devin Dwyer with our political correspondent, Rachel Scott. Rachel, we have some of the best seats in the house here tonight.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,157
Rachel Scott,NA,"I would say so. Right, Devin? They're not too bad.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,158
Devin Dwyer,NA,"What a debate it has been so far. If you're just joining us or joined in the middle, we saw Bernie Sanders defend his attacks on Pete Buttigieg. We saw the former Vice President Joe Biden talk about his weak showing in Iowa. And both of them, Rachel, went on the attack on Pete Buttigieg.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,159
Rachel Scott,NA,"I think one thing is clear here tonight, Devin, this is just not a fight to beat President Trump. This is a fight and a battle over the future of the Democratic Party and we are seeing some very clear lanes being carved out here tonight. You see the moderates versus the progresses and you also see the newcomers to Washington, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, versus those that have lots of political experience on that stage.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,160
Rachel Scott,NA,"And one of the things that comes with having the momentum in this race is having a target on your back. And we saw that tonight for Mayor Pete Buttigieg, getting attack after attack. He tried to fend them off as best as he could saying he is the one that can bring a fresh face to Washington, that Washington needs it right now, but the candidates on that stage questioning his experience and whether or not a small town mayor can beat President Trump and lead the nation.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,161
Devin Dwyer,NA,"And getting right back against Bernie Sanders in his quote, ""My way or the highway,"" approach to politics in the words of Pete Buttigieg. Also calling Joe Biden part of the politics of the past. It was also an interesting moment in this first part of the debate where impeachment made a roaring comeback. It has finished and wrapped up in Washington, but it was a lot of the discussion here on stage, including a standing ovation for those White House officials who were escorted off the job today in an act of retribution.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,162
Rachel Scott,NA,"Yeah, you saw that standing ovation for Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, but also a moment of unity on the stage there and this is something that all of the candidates agree on, right? Mayor Pete Buttigieg who has just ramped up his attacks against the former Vice President in this last stretch came to his defense tonight on that stage saying that, ""We will not allow the Republicans to change the subject."" He said that we need to draw a line against these attacks against Hunter Biden.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,163
Devin Dwyer,NA,"And four days to go before those big votes here in New Hampshire. Coming into this debate, we saw the storyline solidify today in some new polling that just came out. If you haven't seen those numbers, take a look here. We see Bernie Sanders on top of the pack with Pete Buttigieg surging in the last two weeks here in New Hampshire, coming on Sanders heels. This is just one poll from Marist and NBC News. Joe Biden slipping a bit there. Rachel, you have been out on the campaign trail talking to voters in this state and they are still making up their minds.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,164
Rachel Scott,NA,"They are still making up their minds. They just have a few days left to decide and they're eager to hear what the candidates have to say tonight. Well listen, this is a state that Senator Sanders won back in 2016, he's going to be looking for a repeat Devin.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,165
Devin Dwyer,NA,All right. And those candidates now coming back on stage for the second half here year of the ABC News Democratic Debate in New Hampshire. Stay with us here on ABC News Live for much more coverage ahead. And now we'll hand it back to George and the team.,Moderator,unknown,8,1,166
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Welcome back of Saint Anselm College here in New Hampshire and we are here every four years, thanks to our amazing Manchester partner WMUR. And now anchor Monica Hernandez and political director Adam Section are joining us with questions on the minds of New Hampshire voters.",Moderator,male,8,1,167
Monica Hernandez,NA,"Thank you George. It's an honor to be here in our community. We know Granite Staters are engaged and we know there are issues that strike especially close to home here. New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of deadly overdoses in the country. In some cases, police and paramedics tell us that they are saving the same lives again and again, sometimes more than once in a single day. It's a healthcare issue, but it's also so much more. Mayor Buttigieg, you have described yourself as a moderate, but one of your policies at least goes further than some on the stage with you are willing to go. You have called for the decriminalization of all drugs. Does that include heroin, meth, and cocaine, some of the drugs that have contributed to this crisis?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,168
Pete Buttigieg,NA,No. What I've called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession.,Candidate,male,8,1,169
Monica Hernandez,NA,"With all due respect Mayor Buttigieg, on your website it says that you called for decriminalization of all drugs.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,170
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Again, what I'm calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response. This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs, but also as we know from the opioid crisis, some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful. It's why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable. We've got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances. Even while we're also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue, not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction.",Candidate,male,8,1,171
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"That's why medication assisted treatment is so important. And those people who are being revived, and our own EMTs in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody, but then they have nowhere to go. Sometimes you get brought back with a dose of Narcan, but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you, because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country. We must act to change that and save lives when we do.",Candidate,male,8,1,172
Monica Hernandez,NA,"I want to bring this question now to Mr. Yang. You've said you would decriminalize opioids, but you've also said that you would require all overdose patients to go to mandatory treatment centers for three days. Right now in New Hampshire there aren't enough beds in treatment centers and across the country. How would you make sure treatment is available for all overdose patients and what would you do to fill the gap in the meantime?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,173
Andrew Yang,NA,"That's what we have to change, Monica. I've heard heartbreaking stories from families here in New Hampshire that have been destroyed, torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money. As President, we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in New Hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment, you have resources to be able to pursue it.",Candidate,male,8,1,174
Andrew Yang,NA,"This is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem, but money cannot be the obstacle. This is something that happened on the government's watch. The government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment, you know you're not going to be sent to jail. We have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you.",Candidate,male,8,1,175
Andrew Yang,NA,"If you have a family member who's struggling, you can refer them and know that they're not going to have criminal penalties as a result. There are so much about this that's endemic to what's happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok, this hyper corporate capitalism where if money's on one side in this country and people are on the other side, the money is winning. You can see it with the opiate epidemic. You can see it with the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel companies. This is what must change and that's where I'll lead as president.",Candidate,male,8,1,176
Monica Hernandez,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, I want to take the question to you now. As a prosecutor, you embrace tough on crime policies, even with drug offenders. You've also spoken many times about your father's own addiction issues, his own alcoholism and his DUI arrests. If addiction is a disease, should people be arrested for it and as a prosecutor, do you regret sending people with substance abuse issues to jail?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,177
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I led one of the most successful drug courts in the country in Hennepin County, and I always would say and believed, and I think my record shows this, that we weren't a business. We didn't want to see repeat customers. And if you don't want to see repeat customers, the only answer is treatment. And maybe you're referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs. Yes, I felt that we should prosecute those people, but when it comes to, when you asked Mr. Yang a question, and I think it, we owe it to the people of New Hampshire, had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids, to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed. I've been very clear about this.",Candidate,female,8,1,178
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"There's going to be a major settlement coming through, a federal settlement against all these opioid manufacturers. The evidence is overwhelming, including an email where one guy, a business guy, says to the other, ""They're eating them like Doritos. Just keep pumping them out."" We will get a conservative estimate, $40 billion in from that settlement, we can put a 2 cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another 40 billion. Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $18 billion. And just like every other policy I've proposed, and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this, I have showed how I'm going to pay for it. Because I think we have someone in the White House that has told over 15,000 lies. He makes all kinds of promises. The people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better. I will get this done and it is personal for me.",Candidate,female,8,1,179
Adam Sexton,NA,"Good evening candidates. New Hampshire is a battleground, not just for presidential contenders but also for top issues and that includes gun policy. Senator Sanders, for many voters in this Democratic primary, your allure is about consistency when it comes to progressive issues you've been on the right side of them for a long time. One exception is gun rights. In the '90s when you were in Congress, you voted against background checks. You also voted against a waiting period for purchase of a firearm. Can you explain why you opposed these things that you now support?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,180
Bernie Sanders,NA,"I can Adam, and let me also say that in 1988 I probably lost a race for Congress, and we only have one Congress person in the whole state, because in 1988 I said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country. That was 30 years ago. Furthermore, I am very proud that today I have a D- voting record from the NRA. And under my administration it will be the American people doing gun policy, not dictated by the NRA.",Candidate,male,8,1,181
Bernie Sanders,NA,"But to answer your question, I come, like New Hampshire, from a very, very rural state. In Vermont until the last two years ago, we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and I represented that perspective. The world has changed. In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country, people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen. The world has changed and my views have changed, and my view is right now we need universal background checks, we end the gun show loophole, we end the so called straw man provision. We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country, and we go further. We go further, but at the bottom line is I will not be intimidated by the NRA. We're going to run the gun policy that the American people want.",Candidate,male,8,1,182
Adam Sexton,NA,"Vice President Biden, you've taken a lot of heat in this primary, on these debate stages and from voters here in New Hampshire for your past positions. You've essentially asked them to look at the totality of your record and give you the benefit of the doubt. Does Senator Sanders deserve that same benefit of the doubt on guns?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,183
Joe Biden,NA,"Here's the deal. The biggest mistake that Bernie made, that Senator Sanders made, he voted to give the gun manufacturers, the only major industry in America, a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating. First thing I'll do as President is work to get rid of that. It's going to be hard. Think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died. And I might add Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people [inaudible] your gun state and they've come around. In fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands during the same period.",Candidate,male,8,1,184
Joe Biden,NA,"I come from a state that's a major gun owning stare. I introduced the first assault weapons ban. I in fact got it passed. I'm the only guy that beat the NRA twice. While I was pushing the Brady Background Bill to check background checks, Bernie voted five times against that when he was in the House. So look, the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did, I'm the guy that set up drug courts. I set them up. I wrote it into law and it never got funded. And also on opioids, I'm the guy who's already begun to make a down payment. In the Cures Act I put in $1 billion to fight opioid addiction. And lastly, my time is going to be up, surely. Here's the deal. Those Chief Executive Officer of drug companies, they should not only be fined, they should go to jail.",Candidate,male,8,1,185
Adam Sexton,NA,"Senator Warren, we'd like to go over to you now. [inaudible] I want to ask you this question here though. Laws can do so much, if you could change one thing about America's gun culture, what would it be?",Moderator,unknown,8,1,186
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, we have a gun violence problem in America. It is about the mass shootings that we hear about in our schools and that frighten us, about it in theaters and in churches. It's also though about shootings that occur on sidewalks and in playgrounds, often in communities of color that are hit hardest, but there are no headlines over those. It's also about suicide and the increasing lethality of suicide because of the availability of guns. It is also about the increased chances that it's usually a woman will die of domestic violence if she is with a violent man and a gun is in the home.",Candidate,female,8,1,187
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We need to think of this problem not as one and done or three things and done. We need to think of it just like we did on auto safety. We just keep coming back. We treat it like the public health emergency that it is. But the question we should be asking ourselves is when America, across this country, including gun owners, agree in certain basic things, universal background checks, get assault weapons off the streets. Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate?",Candidate,female,8,1,188
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"And the answer is 90%, think about this, more than 90% of Americans agree on this. We can't get a vote in the United States Senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots. Until we attack the corruption in Washington, the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying, we're not going to be able to meet our promises. And one more, until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster, the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make. We have to be willing to build a future that works, not for a gun industry, but that works for the rest of America and protects our children.",Candidate,female,8,1,189
Joe Biden,NA,We ought to be able to sue the gun industry.,Candidate,male,8,1,190
David Muir,NA,"Thank you, candidates. We're going to go back to David up there [inaudible 00:16:26]. Adam and Monica, thank you and thanks to WMUR tonight. I want to turn to the Supreme Court, the balance on the court and the issues before the court right now. President Trump in just the last 24 hours saying we've appointed 191 federal judges, two Supreme Court Justices, keeping his campaign promise to shift the Court to the right with Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.",Moderator,male,8,1,191
David Muir,NA,"The Affordable Care Act is at the court. Climate change is working its way to the court, and a major abortion case is on the docket this year. Vice President Biden, on the issue of abortion, in 2012 you said, ""President Obama's two Supreme Court picks of them, there was no litmus test. We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda."" And you've said before, ""We both believed that we should not apply narrow litmus tests to appointees to the Supreme Court."" Let me just ask, would you do it differently as President, Mr. Vice President? Would there be a litmus test on abortion?",Moderator,male,8,1,192
Joe Biden,NA,"If you say the rest of what I said. I said that we're going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution. That's not a specific test. It's a generic test. And only way, the only reason women have the right to choose is because it's determined that there's unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution. That's what I said. And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan, who worked for me, we got onto the Supreme Court. I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court. I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in. I presided, and I'm the reason why this right wasn't taken away a long time ago because I almost single handedly made sure that Robert Bork did not get on the Court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights [inaudible 00:18:04].",Candidate,male,8,1,193
David Muir,NA,So let me just-,Moderator,male,8,1,194
Joe Biden,NA,Let's get that straight.,Candidate,male,8,1,195
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice President, I am aware of what you said, which is why I'm asking would you do it differently now? Would there be a litmus test on abortion?",Moderator,male,8,1,196
Joe Biden,NA,"Yes. Look, here's the deal. Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution. A woman does have a right to choose. I would in fact, if they rule it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass, I believe, a bill that... Excuse me, legislates Roe V. Wade adjusted by Casey. It's a woman's right to do that. Period. And if you call that a litmus test it's a litmus test, but what I was talking about in the past, so no one gets confused here, is if there is no... If you read the Constitution very, very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights. If the doesn't say it in the Constitution that doesn't exist, you cannot have any of the things I care about, any of the things I care about as a progressive member of the United States Congress at the time, and as Vice President and as a member of society.",Candidate,male,8,1,197
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Vice president, thank you. Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,8,1,198
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I've lived in an America in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and that's what we have to remember about this. States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies, then it's going to mean we can't simply rely on the courts. Three out of every four people in America believe right now that the rule of Roe versus Wade should be the law. That means we should be pushing for a Congressional solution as well. It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a woman's choice.",Candidate,female,8,1,199
David Muir,NA,"Senator Warren, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, I do want to come to you. Should there be a litmus test? It's an active hall here tonight. I did want to come to you on this question.",Moderator,male,8,1,200
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Thank you.,Candidate,female,8,1,201
David Muir,NA,Should there be a litmus test on abortion?,Moderator,male,8,1,202
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"I would only appoint judges that would respect precedent and one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade. In addition, you have got to put it into law. Donald Trump, and I think it's really important to take it to him here, when he was running for election, and this is a case I will make on the debate stage against him, he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail. He then dialed it back and said, ""No, I want to put doctors in jail."" Is it a big surprise then we're seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions. It's not. And that is why it's going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding Planned Parenthood, for making sure women have access to contraception, to making sure that they have a right to choose, that we make this case strongly and loudly.",Candidate,female,8,1,203
David Muir,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, you have signaled that you'd be open to the idea of expanding the Court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested leaving the Court as it is, saying quote, ""Nine seems to be a good number."" And in fact she said if the number of justices is increased quote, ""It would make the Court appear partisan. It would be one side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges to have more people who will vote the way we want them to.'"" Is Justice Ginsburg wrong?",Moderator,male,8,1,204
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence. What I've called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench, but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today. And the time has come for us to think bigger, not just reforming the makeup of the court as America, by the way, has done several times in our history. But also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the Constitution for a reason and we shouldn't be afraid to use it.",Candidate,male,8,1,205
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"It's not something you do lightly or quickly, but when it comes to something like Citizens United, which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an op-ed to your local paper, we need a Constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy.",Candidate,male,8,1,206
David Muir,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Vice President Biden, I do want to come to you on this. President Trump has said that the only reason Democrats want to expand the Court is they want to try and catch up. You have called any expansion of the court a bad idea, adding, ""We will live to rue that day."" Do you agree with President Trump on-",Moderator,male,8,1,207
Joe Biden,NA,"I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That's who I agree with. And I agree the way you deal with Citizens United is pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections. Period. Not private money, not billionaires, not money from special interests. Period. That's the way to amend the Constitution to deal with that. In addition to that, if in fact... Look, the Democrats stood up against the man I've revered, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he wanted to expand the Court. But they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government. It says the President shell nominate, the Senate shall dispose, the Senate shall make that decision, not the president. He can nominate.",Candidate,male,8,1,208
Joe Biden,NA,"That's why it's so important we must win back the United States Senate this time out. And that's why as you all look at it up here in New Hampshire and around the world, excuse me, around the country, you have to ask yourself, who is most likely to help get a Senator elected in North Carolina, Georgia? Who can win Florida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota? Who can do that? Because you got to be able to win those... Well, you can. I agree. But here's the point. You've got to be able to, you've got to be able to not just win, you've got to bring along a United States Senate or this becomes moot.",Candidate,male,8,1,209
David Muir,NA,Senator Sanders [crosstalk 00:24:17].,Moderator,male,8,1,210
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Look, you asked the simple question, is there a litmus test for those of us up here? For me there is. I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who was not 100% pro Roe v. Wade. Number two, we have got a codify Roe v. Wade into legislation. Number three, we have to significantly expand funding for Planned Parenthood.",Candidate,male,8,1,211
David Muir,NA,"Mr. Steyer, I want to bring you in on this because you have claimed that when it comes to the Supreme Court, you have said Republicans have been cheating.",Moderator,male,8,1,212
Tom Steyer,NA,"Sure they've been cheating. Look, what we saw Mitch McConnell do, not just in the Supreme Court with Merrick Garland, but across the board with federal judges, was refuse to allow President Obama's picks to be considered. That's why Mr. Trump has appointed so many federal judges, because in fact the Republicans refused to allow President Obama to get his due, and honestly, we're sitting here talking about do you have a litmus test? We all have the litmus test. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman's right to choose. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way on gun control. Every single one in this row feels the same way.",Candidate,male,8,1,213
Tom Steyer,NA,"There's something else going on. These Republicans are in control. They're stacking the Court for a generation with young right-wing radicals, and we've watched it happen and the question is what are we going to do about it? That's where we are in the United States, and the question is... Actually Joe Biden's right. We have to go win a huge victory this year, and we're in trouble. And so the question is going to be, look at these people, who can pull together the Democratic Party?",Candidate,male,8,1,214
Tom Steyer,NA,"And let me say this, we have not said one word tonight about race. Not one word. Are you kidding me? We have the most diverse party. We have a very diverse country. We have a very diverse party. The heart and soul of this party is diversity, black people, Latinos, AAPI people, Native Americans and white people. But for goodness sakes, pull it together. We're talking about something different. The question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls? What are we saying? Everybody on this stage feels the same way about a woman's right to choose and economic justice. The question is how do we beat Trump? How do we take down these Republicans? And the answer is we've got to show we can take them down on growth, job creation, the economy. We send them packing and then we get all of this including beating the corporations.",Candidate,male,8,1,215
David Muir,NA,"Mr Steyer, thank you. The night is still young. Many questions to come, and Linsey Davis is next.",Moderator,male,8,1,216
Lindsey Davis,NA,I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mayor Buttigieg...,Moderator,female,8,1,217
David Muir,NA,Linsey Davis is next.,Moderator,male,8,1,218
Lindsey Davis,NA,"I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mayor Buttigieg, under your leadership as mayor, a black resident in South Bend, Indiana was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident. Now, that racial disparity is higher than the rest of the state, in fact, it's higher than the rest of the nation, and that disparity increased in South Bend after you took office.",Moderator,female,8,1,219
Lindsey Davis,NA,"When talking about the problem on national terms, you've called it ""evidence of systemic racism."" You were mayor for eight years, so weren't you, in effect, the head of the system, and how do explain that increase in black arrests under your leadership?",Moderator,female,8,1,220
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune. I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department, but we've got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies.",Candidate,male,8,1,221
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"Earlier, we were talking about opioids, and thankfully, America has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem. But there were a lot of people, including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point, it's great that everybody's so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s? That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it, do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration, disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with.",Candidate,male,8,1,222
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Right, let me go back to the original question though. How do you explain the increase in black arrests in South Bend under your leadership for marijuana possession?",Moderator,female,8,1,223
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And again, the overall rate was lower than the national rate.",Candidate,male,8,1,224
Lindsey Davis,NA,"No, there was an increase. The year before you were in office, it was lower. Once you became in office in 2012, that number went up. In 2018, the last number year that we have record for, that number was still up.",Moderator,female,8,1,225
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target, when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence, which was slaughtering so many in our community, burying teenagers, disproportionately black teenagers, we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.",Candidate,male,8,1,226
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"These things are all connected, but that's the point. So are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism, not just from criminal justice, but from our economy, from health, from housing, and from our democracy itself.",Candidate,male,8,1,227
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Senator Warren, is that a substantial answer from Mayor Buttigieg?",Moderator,female,8,1,228
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"No. You have to own up to the fact, and it's important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system. For the exact same crimes, study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained, to be arrested, to be taken to trial, to be wrongfully convicted, and receive harsher sentences. We need to rework our criminal justice system, from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system, and how we help people come back into the community.",Candidate,female,8,1,229
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically. We need to start having race-conscious laws. Housing, for example, I have a great housing plan to build more housing in America, but understand it was the policy of the United States of America to discriminate against African Americans and any other people of color for buying homes until 1965. You can't just repeal that and say ""Okay, now everything is even."" It's not. We need race-conscious laws in education and employment, in entrepreneurship, to make this country a country of opportunity for everyone, no matter the color of their skin.",Candidate,female,8,1,230
Andrew Yang,NA,"Elizabeth, with respect, you can't regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific. What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net work is not 10% of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all. We can't regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities. The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country.",Candidate,male,8,1,231
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Senator Sanders, then Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,female,8,1,232
Tom Steyer,NA,"Let me say this, I disagree. Andrew, no, let me say this. I disagree with you Andrew. I am the person on this stage who will say openly, I'm for reparations. Something wrong happened. I am for reparations to African Americans in this country, and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality. In fact, three days ago, one of the leaders of Joe Biden's South Carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign, and the Legislative Black Caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign. Joe, I'm asking you to come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say. It was wrong, and I'm asking you to join us. Be on the right side.",Candidate,male,8,1,233
Joe Biden,NA,"I'm asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of that Black Caucus. I have more support in South Carolina in the Black Caucus and the black community than anybody else. Double what you have, or anybody else here.",Candidate,male,8,1,234
Bernie Sanders,NA,I don't think that's quite right.,Candidate,male,8,1,235
Tom Steyer,NA,"But wait a second, wait a second. Bernie.",Candidate,male,8,1,236

Lindsey Davis,NA,Senator Sanders ...,Moderator,female,8,1,239
Joe Biden,NA,This is not about polls. I'm not talking about polls.,Candidate,male,8,1,240
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Let me just say, first of all, we have nine members of the Black Caucus in South Carolina supporting us, but more importantly, much of what Elizabeth said is absolutely correct. We have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare, housing, criminal justice, education, you name it. And clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with. But in terms of criminal justice, what we have got to do is understand the system is broken, is racist. We invested our young people in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. We end private prisons and detention centers in America.",Candidate,male,8,1,241
Tom Steyer,NA,"Bernie, I appreciate what you're saying.",Candidate,male,8,1,242
Bernie Sanders,NA,"And, excuse me, we also, most people don't know this. Tonight in America, 200,000 people are in jail without having been convicted of anything.",Candidate,male,8,1,243
Tom Steyer,NA,That's right.,Candidate,male,8,1,244
Bernie Sanders,NA,"200,000 people, because they can't afford the $500 for bail they need to get out of jail. That is outrageous, we're going to end cash bail in America.",Candidate,male,8,1,245
Tom Steyer,NA,"Okay, let me say this. I've worked, Bernie, I've worked to end cash bail in California and it's gone. I've worked to end private prisons in California and they're gone. I'm somebody who's, our family, my wife and I started a bank specifically to support businesses owned by women, black people, and Latinos, because they couldn't get financing anywhere else. But I, Joe, I want a answer. Really. I think you should come over and disavow the statements that this man made that were openly racist, that were wrong, and the Legislative Black Caucus is against. I'm asking you to join us and do the right thing.",Candidate,male,8,1,246
Joe Biden,NA,"I've already spoken to Dick Harpootlian and he in fact is, I believe, sorry for what he said. But here's the deal, folks. We've got to stop taking the black community for granted. That's the starting place. Every one of the things we talked about here, for example, in South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, he has a program, 10-15-30. We should be investing our money in those communities that haven't gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities. Make it a priority. We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense, they go directly, mandatory prison. I mean, excuse me, mandatory treatment, not prison. And we fund it. And we fund it, and three days doesn't get it. It takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress. We have to pay for that.",Candidate,male,8,1,247
Joe Biden,NA,"Just like instead of building new prisons, we build new rehabilitation centers. We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses. You know, if you own a house, I know you do know, if you own a house in an all black neighborhood, same exact house in all white neighborhood, exact same shape, the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less, making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth, as my friend at the end of the line here says. So here's the deal: we have to do much, much more. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place, redlining, to stop it.",Candidate,male,8,1,248
Joe Biden,NA,"I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement, I became a public defender. That's why I got involved. There's so many things we have to do across the board, and in education, at-risk schools. We should triple the funding we have for at-risk schools to provide for three, four, and five years old to go to school, not daycare. Increase the salaries of teachers, encourage more blacks to get into teaching, especially black men, because studies show when there's a black man in a school, it increases prospects significantly, and so on. There's a lot we can do, I've laid it all out as how to do, go to joebiden.com, you'll see the whole deal, including criminal justice reform.",Candidate,male,8,1,249
Lindsey Davis,NA,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. As you mentioned South Carolina, three weeks from tomorrow they'll go to the polls to vote, black voters make up about 60% of the electorate there. Senator Sanders, several weeks ago, Nina Turner, one of your national co-chairs, published an op-ed piece that said Vice President Biden has ""repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with Republican lawmakers and undermine our progress."" Senator Sanders, do you agree with her, one of your most visible surrogates, that Vice President Biden has repeatedly betrayed black voters?",Moderator,female,8,1,250
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, I think what Senator Turner was talking about are some of the early actions of Vice President Biden, but no. Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and I'm not here to attack him. But what I would say is that what we need in terms of the African American community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education, in healthcare. There is no excuse why white families in America have 10 times more wealth than black families. No excuse that disproportionately, African Americans are in jail compared to whites. No excuse for black women dying in childbirth three times the rate that white women are doing as well.",Candidate,male,8,1,251
Lindsey Davis,NA,Senator Klobuchar?,Moderator,female,8,1,252
Amy Klobuchar,NA,Yes.,Candidate,female,8,1,253
Lindsey Davis,NA,You had raised your hand before.,Moderator,female,8,1,254
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Yes I did, because I think in addition to the economic argument we're making here with the sad, sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in New Orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby, and 30% of African American kids being living in poverty, we know that there are economic solutions here, to invest in those communities, housing, childcare. But there's something else insidious going on that we haven't addressed, and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting. That is, moves across the country to limit people's right to vote, and that is why I have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn 18. There is no reason that we can't do that across this country. To stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state, and yes, to stop the voting purges.",Candidate,female,8,1,255
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Because what is going on right now in the words of one North Carolina court is that they are discriminating with surgical precision against African American voters, and we are not going to be able to get any of these things done if we don't give people the right to vote.",Candidate,female,8,1,256
Lindsey Davis,NA,Vice President Biden and then Senator Warren.,Moderator,female,8,1,257
Joe Biden,NA,I beg your pardon?,Candidate,male,8,1,258
Lindsey Davis,NA,I just wanted to give you a chance to respond.,Moderator,female,8,1,259
Joe Biden,NA,"Yes, I agree completely. There should be registration, automatic registration, turning 18, you get a driver's license, whatever you do, you automatically are registered, number one. Number two, with regard to what we're going to see in South Carolina, we're all going to be there pretty soon. We'll see whether or not it works. In response to the letter that the person, I'm not saying Bernie wrote the letter, but the senator who wrote the letter was very brisk and significant with other African Americans in South Carolina taking issue with her.",Candidate,male,8,1,260
Joe Biden,NA,"But look, Amy is right, the senator's correct. That is that we, in fact, there is systematic racism, and that's why our Justice Department works so hard to go after those. You know, realize there are 35 states in the United States of America that have come up with a total of 78 laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep African Americans from voting, and brown as well, black and brown people from voting. And that will be an enormous priority in my administration as it was in ours. It's just wrong, simply wrong.",Candidate,male,8,1,261
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"I'm glad to stand on this stage with my fellow Democrats who talk about how important the black community is, at least at election time. Year after year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say ""Boy, we really care about these issues. Racism is terrible, we all want to do something,"" and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well I think it's time we have real, concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people's lives. I proposed a two cent wealth tax. And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax. We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college, borrow more money while they're in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out, that one law is going to help close the black-white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points.",Candidate,female,8,1,262
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We aren't making a difference in America. We're saying to the rich folks ""You keep your money, and the rest of us will talk about racism but not really do anything."" I think the time for that is over, I'm ready to get in this fight and really make a change.",Candidate,female,8,1,263
Joe Biden,NA,"Okay, thank you.",Candidate,male,8,1,264
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Actually, let's keep this debate going. Go ahead, Mr. Steyer.",Moderator,male,8,1,265
Tom Steyer,NA,"Out of narrative comes policy. And we're talking about a lot of policies that affect Americans, broadly and disproportionately affect black Americans or brown Americans. But what I believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly. Because everyone's saying we can't have rules that are different for different people, but in fact we're here because we had rules that are different for different people. I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans, not just legal discrimination, injustice, and cruelty, but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries. Because I believe out of narrative comes policy. We need to repair damage that's been done officially, and pretending we're all the same is not accurate. We got here a certain way. Let's talk about Jim Crow, let's talk about Martin Luther King, let's talk about Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland who's one of our great leaders, and then let's figure out how to repair the damage so we can move forward together.",Candidate,male,8,1,266
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Mr. Yang, take on that argument, also what he said about reparations.",Moderator,male,8,1,267
Andrew Yang,NA,"The median African American household net work is projected to be zero by 2053. Things are not getting better for people of color. If anything, they're getting wore, because we're in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy. It's something of an economic unnatural disaster, and who suffers most in a natural disaster? People of color, people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education.",Candidate,male,8,1,268
Andrew Yang,NA,"And while I know we love to champion education here as Democrats, only 33% of Americans are going attend college, lower percentage of African Americans. There is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out African American net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and 2053, and it's not just them, it is truck drivers, it is retail clerks, it is call center workers, it is accountants, it is bookkeepers. We are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country, and it's going to hit black people the hardest. We have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem.",Candidate,male,8,1,269
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"We've been getting a lot of questions from Apple News in tonight, including many about a candidate who's not on the stage tonight, but is in this race, and that is former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York.

Why do you think you are better positioned than Bloomberg to beat Trump?"" Senator Warren.",Moderator,male,8,1,270
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Look, I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States. I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns out to do it. I heard everyone here talking about as Democrats, we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end this unlimited spending, yeah. Except everyone on this stage except Amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending.

If you think it's the right way to run a campaign, to go elizabethwarren.com and pitch in $5, because understand this: our democracy hangs in the balance.

Now I've been very clear on both my record, where I have sued pharmaceutical companies, and what I'm campaigning for, that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire, I know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of South Bend, Indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse.",Candidate,male,8,1,288
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"We are here without the involvement of any corporate PACs because hundreds of thousands of people went to, yes, peteforamerica.com, contributed to this campaign, and let me say something else. If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here, we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump. And in order to do that, we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject, but how we bring everybody into the fold. And if you are low-income, or if you're able to contribute a lot. If you've always voted Democrat, or if you're an Independent or even a Republican who's just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House, we need you to join us right now. I will not pursue politics by telling people they can't be at our side if they're not with us 100% of the time. This is a time for addition, not rejection, for belonging, not exclusion.",Candidate,male,8,1,289
David Muir,NA,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. I want to turn to climate change and jobs here in America. President Trump just signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, many call it an updated NAFTA. But it odes include incentives to make cars here in North America and it does open Canadian markets for American dairy farmers. Senator Sanders, as we sit here in New Hampshire tonight, both New Hampshire senators Maggie Hassan and Senator Jeanne Shaheen supported this, calling it a real win for workers and for farmers. You voted no, because you said you believe it takes us back years on climate. Were the senators from New Hampshire wrong?",Moderator,male,8,1,290
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Yes. I mean, it's a disagreement, but if you look at every environmental group in this country, including the Sunrise organization, we're so proud to have their support, because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal I think ever authored by a presidential candidate. But they are saying, what the environmental groups are saying, we're simply exporting fossil fuel emissions to Mexico. There is not one word in that trade agreement ...",Candidate,male,8,1,291
Bernie Sanders,NA,"There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I don't know how in 2020 you can do that. Second of all, there is, in terms of outsourcing of jobs, a major crisis in this country. Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico, where workers are paid in some cases less than $2 an hour. So I think the right vote was the vote against that agreement. I don't apologize for that.",Candidate,male,8,1,292
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Sanders, thank you. I do want to go to Senator Klobuchar. You've heard what Senator Sanders just said there. He said not one word on climate in the trade deal. So why did you vote yes?",Moderator,male,8,1,293
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"Well, first of all, I want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, who work so hard for this state every day and I voted with them. Why did I vote with them? Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections, when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change, I think we have to have a North American trading block. We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president, yes, I'll work to make this a part of every future trade agreement, but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement, which I will do on day one.",Candidate,female,8,1,294
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"It is bringing back the clean power rules. It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that, and in future trade agreements, that should be part of our negotiations. But I'm telling you right now, having no trade agreement with Canada and Mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China and pushing China to do better when it comes to climate change.",Candidate,female,8,1,295
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you. Senator Warren, you voted yes as well.",Moderator,male,8,1,296
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"Yes I did, and I'll tell you why, because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of Donald Trump's trade policies. There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they can't get enforcement of any workers' rights. So this NAFTA provision, after a lot of negotiation with Democrats, Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better. This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country, I'm saying, I'll sign up for that and then I'll get up tomorrow morning and I'll start working hard for a better trade deal on climate, a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it. Everyone wants to get to the American market. We should be raising standards on climate around the world to get access to our market.",Candidate,female,8,1,297
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Mr. Steyer.,Moderator,male,8,1,298
Tom Steyer,NA,"Yeah, I got to agree with Bernie Sanders, I do. Senator Warren is right. Everybody wants to get into our market, and that's how we convince them that they've got to be right on climate too. That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way. Yeah, of course, we want to make things better for American workers, and it's absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy, we're thinking about it from the point of view of the American people, not of the American corporations. That's a huge positive change. And I agree with the senators on that, but there's something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy. We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani, and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world.",Candidate,male,8,1,299
Tom Steyer,NA,"So if we actually want to be the leaders of the world, the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks, that makes a difference, we're going to have to put climate first, and when we think about doing the wrong thing, the way Mr. Trump did with General Soleimani, we have to ask, does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing? It absolutely does not.",Candidate,male,8,1,300
Tom Steyer,NA,"Being all by ourselves, being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world. So in fact, the USMCA is something, that's the first step, but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying. Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers, but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal.",Candidate,male,8,1,301
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things aren't always exactly how you would do them. But in this case, if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends, and I would agree, he always sides with tyrants over innocents. He always sides with dictators over allies, but I think you've got to have some friends and those two countries, our neighbors, may not be perfect, but they are our friends, and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough.",Candidate,female,8,1,302
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong. He blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself. He blames the King of Denmark, who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2, who does that? That's what Donald Trump does. So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies, and New Hampshire is such a great example of this, New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen, who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state, but a state that is a piece of the world. We cannot be alone, and that trade agreement was not perfect, but the point of it is, if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world, we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nation's security.",Candidate,female,8,1,303
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"All right. Senator Klobuchar, thanks very much. We have hit the two hour mark, we need to take a quick break and come back for the final question.",Moderator,male,8,1,304
Devin Dwyer,NA,"Welcome back to Manchester, New Hampshire and the ABC News Democratic Debate. Thanks for joining us here on ABC News Live tonight. I'm Devin Dwyer, joined with our political correspondent, Rachel Scott. Rachel, we heard so much this last block about gun policy, abortion, climate change, and then the issue of race, pushed on by Tom Steyer and really a lot of the candidates confronting Joe Biden, a sign of where this campaign is headed.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,305
Rachel Scott,NA,"Exactly, Devin. Steyer tonight calling out the lack of discussion when it comes to race on that stage, the conversation turning 90 minutes into this debate and Biden touting what the national polls reflect. His loyalty among African American voters. I have sat down with the vice president, he has told me it's one of the things that he is most proud of, his loyalty among black supporters, and if you want to just see how important black voters are to the democratic base, all you have to look at are the numbers from 2016, the exit polls from that primary, 6 out of 10 voters in Mississippi were black, 61% of voters in the South Carolina primary were black, and that's where the candidates are going to be heading very soon ahead of that.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,306
Devin Dwyer,NA,"And to Nevada as well with a lot of voters of color there and Joe Biden holding a lion's share of those voters. We'll see if these candidates can chip away. You know, we were talking so many of the policies we heard about tonight, like so many of the previous debates, are familiar positions from these candidates, which is why the style of their performance tonight is going to get a lot of attention from voters.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,307
Rachel Scott,NA,"It will, but you know, when I talk to voters as I travel the country, they tell me their number one concern is electability. They want someone that could be President Trump, they want someone that could carry this over the finish line and that's why you hear so much of the session pitting back to who can do that on that stage today.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,308
Devin Dwyer,NA,"I was up in Derry, New Hampshire just yesterday hearing not only a lot of attention on those qualities of style, but also a lot of anxiety over this issue of electability particularly now with Donald Trump's polling numbers on the rise, his performance at the State of the Union and his acquittal in that Senate trial. It's going to be a four day sprint, I know you're going to be out there all weekend as I will as well and we were just talking about what this moment in this campaign will mean. We could see a dramatically smaller field after Tuesday night here in New Hampshire.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,309
Rachel Scott,NA,"Tom Perez came out here and he said, listen, we are beginning a 90 day sprint. Most of the delegates are going to be grabbed up by the end of this 90 days and the candidates really have to hone in on their pitch here. The voting has started, already. We're moving into the New Hampshire primary and a lot of these candidates have a lot on the line here. They only have a few days left to gain momentum before that next vote is cast, and again, this race is getting tighter and tighter.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,310
Devin Dwyer,NA,"And we know Donald Trump will be here in New Hampshire and Manchester as well, on Monday. So things are going to get a little even more exciting four days ahead of the New Hampshire primaries. We had back now for the final question in this ABC News Democratic Debate. Take a look at the speaking times of the candidates. We'll leave you with that. Joe Biden, top of the list, all the candidates back at their podiums. Stay with us right here on ABC News Live.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,311
Announcer,NA,"The democratic debate. Here now, George Stephanopoulos.",Moderator,unknown,8,1,312
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Welcome back to our debate, time now for a final question. Each of you will answer it in turn. We'll start with Mr.Yang, and the question is this. According to the Children's Defense Fund, it's been more than 20 years since child poverty was directly addressed in a presidential debate. The year was 1999 the question was our friend and former [inaudible] who may be watching right now, the late Cokie Roberts.",Moderator,male,8,1,313
George Stephanopoulos,NA,"Cokie loved the New Hampshire primary, and she asked the candidates in this Republican debate, how will we overcome the scandal of one quarter of American preschoolers living in poverty in the richest nation on earth? Today, nearly one in five American preschoolers are still living below the poverty line, even though we've had 10 straight years of economic growth. What does that say to you about where America is today and what we need to do about it?",Moderator,male,8,1,314
Andrew Yang,NA,"George, we're in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country, and unfortunately, that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger, smarter, more capable all the time, and most of us are not. Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day. So if we want to alleviate child poverty, we need to put money directly into the hands of families, particularly single parents, 40% of American children today are born to single moms, 90% of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth.",Candidate,male,8,1,315
Andrew Yang,NA,"What is the market value my wife, Evelyn had, or stay at home parents around the country? Zero. Caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones, like Kyle Christensen in Iowa? Zero. Volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive? Zero. Coaches and mentors helping our kids? Zero. Most artists, sorry artists, but it's true. Zero. Increasingly local journalists, which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you can't vote on something if you actually don't have any news coverage. The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value, say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans. That we each have intrinsic value as citizens, as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world.",Candidate,male,8,1,316
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"The problem is, America's been counting the wrong things. Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. I'm sure if you've got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you. But the problem is, we've had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need, or even so many in the middle.",Candidate,male,8,1,317
Pete Buttigieg,NA,"When I'm president, we're going to measure the performance of our economy, not by the Dow Jones but by the income growth of the 90%, because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty. Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate, in particular, the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have. This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change. The American people, not just die hard Democrats, but so many Independents and some Republicans, think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesn't happen. That is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics. To turn the page, leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late.",Candidate,male,8,1,318
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Warren.,Moderator,male,8,1,319
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"So I started my grownup life as a special education teacher. I learned early on about the worth of every single human being, and I believe that the best investment we can make as a nation, the best investment we can make as human beings, is to invest in our children. We've had enough of making rhetoric around this. Everyone says they love the kids, but here's the deal. It's time to come up with real plans to make that happen. I've talked before about a two cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.",Candidate,female,8,1,320
Elizabeth Warren,NA,"We want to have a real future in this country, then invest in our children. Don't leave public education just to our localities in our states. Be a good federal partner. Put real money into our schools, put real money into housing, put real money into into healthcare. Put real money into the future of our children. That's how we build the America of our best values.",Candidate,female,8,1,321
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Mr. Vice President.,Moderator,male,8,1,322
Joe Biden,NA,"I come from a family where our dad walked in one day and said, we've got to move. Don't have a job. We've got to move to a different city. I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others, who go through the same thing where the father's made that longest walk or the mother's made that longest walk. I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress. My net worth was net zero a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that I've never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years. It's not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others, but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here.",Candidate,male,8,1,323
Joe Biden,NA,"These aren't someone else's children. They're all our children. They're the kite strings that lift our national ambitions, they really are. They lift our national ambitions aloft. We have an overwhelming interest, overwhelming interest in seeing to it they do well. You know, 24 out of every 100 students in school today, from grade school to high school, are Latino. What are we going to do? Walk away from that?",Candidate,male,8,1,324
Joe Biden,NA,"Many of them come from homes that are poor, very poor. That's why I invest so much time and energy in preschool. That's why if I only have $1 to spend, I spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day, than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating. A great number of them, as Mr. Yang said, aren't going on to college, although I think we should help with college. They're not going on to college. What they're going to do, they're going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades, the new opportunities, the new capabilities that are out there. We must focus on our children. Like I said, they're all our children, they're not somebody else's kids. Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, as my father would say, is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and we're not doing it.",Candidate,male,8,1,325
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Sanders.,Moderator,male,8,1,326
Bernie Sanders,NA,"Well, the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, disproportionately high for the African American community, by the way, is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations. Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America.",Candidate,male,8,1,327
Bernie Sanders,NA,"The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs, and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1% and by wealthy campaign contributors. Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country. What is unique about our campaign, is we say, unashamedly, we are raising our campaign contributions, not from billionaires but from working class people. That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run. It is time to take on the big money interests. It is time to change our national priorities. Thank you.",Candidate,male,8,1,328
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Senator Klobuchar.,Moderator,male,8,1,329
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"In Cokie's memory, let me answer this question. We may have lost an election in 2016, Democrats, but we did not lose hope. And there is a way, it's actually based on a National Academy of Science report and I've used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in 10 years and eradicate it in a generation. We can do it with investment in childcare. We can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done. But to get it done, we have to be able to reach those voters that we lost in this state and across the country.",Candidate,female,8,1,330
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"There's an old story of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and when he died, his body was put on a train and went up across America and there was a guy standing by those tracks along with so many Americans, and he had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and a reporter said, Sir, did you know the president? And the guy says, no, I didn't know the president, but he knew me. He knew me. I will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now. I will bring that to you.",Candidate,female,8,1,331
Amy Klobuchar,NA,"If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent. I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you're going to pay for your childcare or your longterm care, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble figuring out if you're going to fill your refrigerator or fill your prescription drug, I know you and I will fight for you. I do not have the biggest name up on this stage. I don't have the biggest bank account. I'm not a political newcomer with no record, but I have a record of fighting for people. I'm asking you to join us@amyklobuchar.com. I'm asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in America can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me, Please, New Hampshire, I would love your vote and I would love the vote of America. Thank you.",Candidate,female,8,1,332
George Stephanopoulos,NA,Mr. Steyer.,Moderator,male,8,1,333
Tom Steyer,NA,"The Republicans have a cruel plan and their plan is pretty simple. It's to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids, by cutting healthcare across the board, by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want, and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement. It's very simple. That's what Mr. Trump's plan is and it's true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country. It's not just that he does bad things. He doesn't understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it. So in fact, what we need to do is have a new conception, a new dream of America, dream it and make it happen. Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together. We are in perilous times. I am asking for your vote. Let's rise together.",Candidate,male,8,1,334

Martha Raddatz,NA,"Thanks very much George and good evening from high above the debate stage here in Manchester. After the sometimes fiery exchanges between the top seven democratic candidates, it was a profoundly important debate. The last big chance for the candidates to make their case before the first in the nation primary this Tuesday.
