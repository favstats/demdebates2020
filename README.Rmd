# demdebates2020


The goal of `demdebates2020` is to provide access to all transcripts of the Democratic debates of the 2020 Presidential Election.

## Usage

The package includes a single dataset: `debates`. This dataset represents the spoken words of all Democratic candidates for US president at ten Democratic debates. The following [sources](https://github.com/favstats/demdebates2020#sources) have been used to compile the data: Washington Post, Des Moines Register and rev.com. The dataset has the following eight columns:

+ `speaker`: Who is speaking
+ `background`: Reactions from the audience, includes `(APPLAUSE)` or `(LAUGHTER)` 
    + only availabe for the first seven and ninth debates
+ `speech`: Transcribed speech
+ `type`: Candidate, Moderator or Protester
+ `gender`: The gender of the person speaking
+ `debate`: Which debate 
+ `day`: Which day of the debate 
    + first and second debate were held on two separate days
+ `order`: The order in which the speech acts were delivered

There are two ways in which you can access the dataset.

1. Read .csv file directly from GitHub

```{r eval=F}
debates_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/demdebates2020/master/data/debates.csv"

debates <- readr::read_csv(debates_url)

```

2. Install and load the R package like this:

```{r eval=F}
devtools::install_github("favstats/demdebates2020")

library(demdebates2020)
``` 

## Example

```{r eval=T}
demdebates2020::debates %>% 
  dplyr::slice(1508:1510) %>% 
  knitr::kable()


```
